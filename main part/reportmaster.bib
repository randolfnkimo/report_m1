	abstract = {Autism spectrum disorder ({ASD}) is mainly described as a disorder of communication and socialization. However, motor abnormalities are also common in {ASD}. New technologies may offer quantitative and automatic metrics to measure movement difficulties. We sought to identify computational methods to automatize the assessment of motor impairments in {ASD}. We systematically searched for the terms ’autism’, ’movement’, ’automatic’, ’computational’ and ’engineering’ in {IEEE} (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers), Medline and Scopus databases and reviewed the literature from inception to 2018. We included all articles discussing: (1) automatic assessment/new technologies, (2) motor behaviours and (3) children with {ASD}. We excluded studies that included patient’s or parent’s reported outcomes as online questionnaires that focused on computational models of movement, but also eye tracking, facial emotion or sleep. In total, we found 53 relevant articles that explored static and kinetic equilibrium, like posture, walking, fine motor skills, motor synchrony and movements during social interaction that can be impaired in individuals with autism. Several devices were used to capture relevant motor information such as cameras, 3D cameras, motion capture systems, accelerometers. Interestingly, since 2012, the number of studies increased dramatically as technologies became less invasive, more precise and more affordable. Open-source software has enabled the extraction of relevant data. In a few cases, these technologies have been implemented in serious games, like “Pictogram Room”, to measure the motor status and the progress of children with {ASD}. Movement computing opens new perspectives for patient assessment in {ASD} research, enabling precise characterizations in experimental and at-home settings, and a better understanding of the role of sensorimotor disturbances in the development of social cognition and {ASD}. These methods would likely enable researchers and clinicians to better distinguish {ASD} from other motors disorders while facilitating an improved monitoring of children’s progress in more ecological settings (i.e. at home or school).},

This study presents preliminary analysis of grasping activity. Three preterm infants performed 4 weeks of daily training at home. Sensorized toys with embedded pressure sensors were used as part of the training to allow quantitative analysis of grasping (pressure and acceleration applied to toys while playing). Each toy was placed on the midline, while the infant was in supine position. Preliminary data show differences in the grasping parameters in relation to infants age and the performed daily training. Ongoing clinical trial will allow a full validation of this new tool for promoting object exploration in preterm infants.},

	doi = {10.1186/1743-0003-11-133},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Existing motor pattern assessment methods, such as digital cameras and optoelectronic systems, suffer from object obstruction and require complex setups. To overcome these drawbacks, this paper presents a novel approach for biomechanical evaluation of newborn motor skills development. Multi-sensor measurement system comprising pressure mattress and {IMUs} fixed on trunk and arms is proposed and used as alternative to existing methods. Observed advantages seem appealing for the focused field and in general. Combined use of pressure distribution data and kinematic information is important also for posture assessment, ulcer prevention, and non-invasive sleep pattern analysis of adults.
{METHODS}: Arm kinematic parameters, such as root-mean-square acceleration, spectral arc length of hand velocity profile, including arm workspace surface area, and travelled hand path are obtained with the multi-sensor measurement system and compared to normative motion capture data for evaluation of adequacy. Two {IMUs} per arm, only one {IMU} on upper arm, and only one {IMU} on forearm sensor placement options are studied to assess influence of system configuration on method precision. Combination of pressure mattress and {IMU} fixed on the trunk is used to measure trunk position (obtained from mat), rotation (from {IMUs}) and associated movements on surface (from both). Measurement system is first validated on spontaneous arm and trunk movements of a dedicated baby doll having realistic anthropometric characteristics of newborns. Next, parameters of movements in a healthy infant are obtained with pressure mattress, along with trunk and forearm {IMU} sensors to verify appropriateness of method and parameters.
{RESULTS}: Evaluation results confirm that full sensor set, comprising pressure mattress and two {IMUs} per arm is a reliable substitution to optoelectronic systems. Motor pattern parameter errors are under 10\% and kinematic estimation error is in range of 2 cm. Although, use of only forearm {IMU} is not providing best possible kinematic precision, the simplicity of use and still acceptable accuracy are convincing for frequent practical use. Measurements demonstrated system high mobility and usability.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Study results confirm adequacy of the proposed multi-sensor measurement system, indicating its enviable potential for accurate infant trunk posture and arm movement assessment.},

Intensive custom-tailored training activities are usually accompanied by assessment procedures, which have shortcomings, such as subjectivity, complex setups, and need for structured environments. A novel sensorized system, called {CareToy}, was designed to provide stimulation in the form of goal-directed activity training scenarios and motor pattern assessment of main developmental milestones, such as rolling activity, grasping, and postural stability. A group of 28 differently skilled preterm infants were enrolled. Acquired measurement data were analysed with dedicated sensor data processing algorithms, along with clinical evaluation of motor ability. High correlation among technically determined parameters and Alberta Infant Motor Scale values was determined by Pearson correlation coefficients. Due to good accuracy and possibility of single motor skill subfield analysis, results confirm system suitability for motor ability assessment. Statistical analysis of inter-motor ability group and inter-training goal data comparisons demonstrate system’s appropriateness for goal-directed activity stimulation. The proposed system has evident potential of being an important contribution to the field of infant motor development assessment, expanding accessibility of early intervention programs and affecting rehabilitation effectiveness of preterm infants.},

The robot encouraged engagement, adapted the difficulty of the activities to the child's past performance, and modeled positive social skills. The system maintained engagement over the 1-month deployment, and children showed improvement on joint attention skills with adults when not in the presence of the robot. These results were also consistent with caregiver questionnaires. Caregivers reported less prompting over time and overall increased communication.},

There was a significant correlation between the number of reports per year and the year of publication. Serious games appeared promising because they can support training on many different skills and they favour interactions in diverse contexts and situations, some of which may resemble real life. However, the currently available serious games exhibit some limitations: (i) most of them are developed for High-Functioning individuals; (ii) their clinical validation has rarely met the evidence-based medicine standards; (iii) the game design is not usually described; and, (iv) in many cases, the clinical validation and playability/game design are not compatible. Future research agendas should encompass (i) more robust studies in terms of methodology (large samples, control groups, longer treatment periods, follow-up to assess whether changes remain stable, etc.) to assess serious game efficacy; (ii) more collaboration between clinical and computer/game design experts; and (iii) more serious games that are adapted to Low-Functioning {ASD} individuals.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: Autism Behavior Inventory ({ABI}) is a new measure for assessing changes in core and associated symptoms of autism spectrum disorder ({ASD}) in participants (ages: 3 years-adulthood) diagnosed with {ASD}. It is a web-based tool with five domains (two {ASD} core domains: social communication, restrictive and repetitive behaviors; three associated domains: mental health, self-regulation, and challenging behavior). This study describes design, development, and initial psychometric properties of the {ABI}.
{METHODS}: {ABI} items were generated following review of existing measures and inputs from expert clinicians. Initial {ABI} scale contained 161 items that were reduced to fit a factor analytic model, retaining items of adequate reliability. Two versions of the scale, {ABI}-full ({ABI}-F; 93 items) and {ABI}-short version ({ABI}-S; 36 items), were developed and evaluated for psychometric properties, including validity comparisons with commonly used measures. Both scales were administered to parents and healthcare professionals ({HCPs}) involved with study participants.
{RESULTS}: Test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient [{ICC}] = 0.79) for parent ratings on {ABI} was robust and compared favorably to existing scales. Test-retest correlations for {HCP} ratings were generally lower versus parent ratings. {ABI} core domains and comparison measures strongly correlated (r ≥ 0.70), demonstrating good concurrent validity.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Overall, {ABI} demonstrates promise as a tool for measuring change in core symptoms of autism in {ASD} clinical studies, with further validation required.},

	abstract = {The early detection of developmental disorders is key to child outcome, allowing interventions to be initiated which promote development and improve prognosis. Research on autism spectrum disorder ({ASD}) suggests that behavioral signs can be observed late in the first year of life. Many of these studies involve extensive frame-by-frame video observation and analysis of a child's natural behavior. Although nonintrusive, these methods are extremely time-intensive and require a high level of observer training; thus, they are burdensome for clinical and large population research purposes. This work is a first milestone in a long-term project on non-invasive early observation of children in order to aid in risk detection and research of neurodevelopmental disorders. We focus on providing low-cost computer vision tools to measure and identify {ASD} behavioral signs based on components of the Autism Observation Scale for Infants ({AOSI}). In particular, we develop algorithms to measure responses to general {ASD} risk assessment tasks and activities outlined by the {AOSI} which assess visual attention by tracking facial features. We show results, including comparisons with expert and nonexpert clinicians, which demonstrate that the proposed computer vision tools can capture critical behavioral observations and potentially augment the clinician's behavioral observations obtained from real in-clinic assessments.},

We built a system that employed a Nao robot and a perception system based on a {RGB}-D sensor (Kinect) to capture social engagement cues. A {JA} induction experiment was performed in which children with {ASD} (N = 16) and matched {TD} children (N = 16) had a 3-min interaction with the robot or with a therapist. Nao induced {JA} by gazing; by gazing and pointing; and by gazing, pointing and vocalizing at pictures. Both groups of children performed well with the therapist. However, with Nao, both groups had lower {JA} scores, and the children with {ASD} had a significantly lower score than the {TD} children. We found that (i) multimodal {JA} induction was more efficient in both groups; (ii) the 3D spatial world gaze exploration showed less accuracy; and (iii) the trunk position in {ASD} showed less stability in the 4 dimensions compared to {TD} controls.
We conclude that, in {ASD}, {JA} skill depends on the interaction partner, and implies a higher motor and cognitive cost.},

The proposed system shows the feasibility and the practical benefits of the use of social robots as assessment tools of {ASD}. We propose a set of measures to describe the behaviour of the children in terms of body and head movements, gazing magnitude, gazing directions (left vs. front vs. right) and kinetic energies. We assessed these metrics by comparing 42 children with {ASD} and 16 children with typical development ({TD}) during the {JA} task with the robot, highlighting significant differences between the two groups. Employing the same metrics, we also assess a subgroup of 14 children with {ASD} after 6-month of {JA} training with a serious game. The longitudinal data confirms the relevance of the proposed metrics as they reveal the improvements of children behaviours after several months of training.},

Artificial neural network-based learning systems are well known for their pattern recognition capabilities, and lately their deep architectures—known as deep learning ({DL})—have been successfully applied to solve many complex pattern recognition problems. To investigate how {DL}—especially its different architectures—has contributed and been utilized in the mining of biological data pertaining to those three types, a meta-analysis has been performed and the resulting resources have been critically analysed.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Machine learning has attracted considerable research interest toward developing smart digital health interventions. These interventions have the potential to revolutionize health care and lead to substantial outcomes for patients and medical professionals.
{OBJECTIVE}: Our objective was to review the literature on applications of machine learning in real-life digital health interventions, aiming to improve the understanding of researchers, clinicians, engineers, and policy makers in developing robust and impactful data-driven interventions in the health care domain.
{METHODS}: We searched the {PubMed} and Scopus bibliographic databases with terms related to machine learning, to identify real-life studies of digital health interventions incorporating machine learning algorithms. We grouped those interventions according to their target (ie, target condition), study design, number of enrolled participants, follow-up duration, primary outcome and whether this had been statistically significant, machine learning algorithms used in the intervention, and outcome of the algorithms (eg, prediction).
{RESULTS}: Our literature search identified 8 interventions incorporating machine learning in a real-life research setting, of which 3 (37\%) were evaluated in a randomized controlled trial and 5 (63\%) in a pilot or experimental single-group study. The interventions targeted depression prediction and management, speech recognition for people with speech disabilities, self-efficacy for weight loss, detection of changes in biopsychosocial condition of patients with multiple morbidity, stress management, treatment of phantom limb pain, smoking cessation, and personalized nutrition based on glycemic response. The average number of enrolled participants in the studies was 71 (range 8-214), and the average follow-up study duration was 69 days (range 3-180). Of the 8 interventions, 6 (75\%) showed statistical significance (at the P=.05 level) in health outcomes.
{CONCLUSIONS}: This review found that digital health interventions incorporating machine learning algorithms in real-life studies can be useful and effective. Given the low number of studies identified in this review and that they did not follow a rigorous machine learning evaluation methodology, we urge the research community to conduct further studies in intervention settings following evaluation principles and demonstrating the potential of machine learning in clinical practice.},

	abstract = {Psychiatry today must gain a better understanding of the common and distinct pathophysiological mechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders in order to deliver more effective, person-tailored treatments. To this end, it appears that the analysis of ‘small’ experimental samples using conventional statistical approaches has largely failed to capture the heterogeneity underlying psychiatric phenotypes. Modern algorithms and approaches from machine learning, particularly deep learning, provide new hope to address these issues given their outstanding prediction performance in other disciplines. The strength of deep learning algorithms is that they can implement very complicated, and in principle arbitrary predictor-response mappings efficiently. This power comes at a cost, the need for large training (and test) samples to infer the (sometimes over millions of) model parameters. This appears to be at odds with the as yet rather ‘small’ samples available in psychiatric human research to date (n {\textless} 10,000), and the ambition of predicting treatment at the single subject level (n = 1). Here, we aim at giving a comprehensive overview on how we can yet use such models for prediction in psychiatry. We review how machine learning approaches compare to more traditional statistical hypothesis-driven approaches, how their complexity relates to the need of large sample sizes, and what we can do to optimally use these powerful techniques in psychiatric neuroscience.},

Early identification can help improve outcome through therapy-based interventions. Absence of so-called "fidgety movements" is a strong predictor of cerebral palsy. Currently, infant limb movements captured through either video cameras or accelerometers are analyzed to identify fidgety movements. However both modalities have their limitations. Video cameras do not have the high temporal resolution needed to capture subtle movements. Accelerometers have low spatial resolution and capture only relative movement. In order to overcome these limitations, we have developed a system to combine measurements from both camera and sensors to estimate the true underlying motion using extended Kalman filter. The estimated motion achieved 84\% classification accuracy in identifying fidgety movements using Support Vector Machine.},

	abstract = {Stereotypical behaviour such as arm flapping is among the prominent early signs for young children with Autism Spectrum Disorder ({ASD}). Diagnosis of arm flapping requires clinicians to use the standard Repetitive Behaviour Scale-Revised ({RBSR}) which is a structured questionnaire with the caregivers to detect the arm flapping behavioural patterns or cues. This method involves clinicians in multiple long sessions, risking a delay in diagnosis and usually an expensive process. Moreover, trained clinicians may not be available in some areas. The focus of this work is to propose a development of a computational framework to automate the diagnosis process of arm flapping. Here, we show how the human action recognition ({HAR}) techniques, namely, the pose estimation and the skeletal representation are utilized simultaneously to segment parts of the human body (head, neck, elbows and shoulders) into stickman model. We show how the stickman model allows us to estimate arm asymmetry (during arm flapping) which indicates possible sign of autism. The framework developed has been tested against data taken from a public database and has shown a high accuracy in detecting the repetitive behavioural pattern among young children. The results show that our method can provide efficient results in clinical assessment.},

Early identification of infants at risk for neurodevelopmental disorders is a major prerequisite for intervention programmes. This ensures that interventions which aim to positively modify the natural history of these disorders can start in the first weeks or months of life. As indicated by recent scientific evidence, gene abnormalities or congenital brain lesions are not the sole determinants for the neurodevelopmental outcome of affected infants. In fact, environment and experience may modify brain development and improve the outcome in infants at risk for neurodevelopmental disorders. In this review, we analyse the complexity and sensitivity of the brain to environmental stimuli, highlighting clinical effects of early intervention, mainly reported so far in preterm infants, and summarizing the effects of enriched environment on human and animal models. Finally, we discuss some new approaches to early intervention, based on recent neurophysiological theories and new breakthroughs in biotechnologies for diagnosis and rehabilitation.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Preterm birth is the second largest direct cause of child deaths in children younger than 5 years. Yet, data regarding preterm birth ({\textless}37 completed weeks of gestation) are not routinely collected by {UN} agencies, and no systematic country estimates nor time trend analyses have been done. We report worldwide, regional, and national estimates of preterm birth rates for 184 countries in 2010 with time trends for selected countries, and provide a quantitative assessment of the uncertainty surrounding these estimates.
{METHODS}: We assessed various data sources according to prespecified inclusion criteria. National Registries (563 datapoints, 51 countries), Reproductive Health Surveys (13 datapoints, eight countries), and studies identified through systematic searches and unpublished data (162 datapoints, 40 countries) were included. 55 countries submitted additional data during {WHO}'s country consultation process. For 13 countries with adequate quality and quantity of data, we estimated preterm birth rates using country-level loess regression for 2010. For 171 countries, two regional multilevel statistical models were developed to estimate preterm birth rates for 2010. We estimated time trends from 1990 to 2010 for 65 countries with reliable time trend data and more than 10,000 livebirths per year. We calculated uncertainty ranges for all countries.
{FINDINGS}: In 2010, an estimated 14·9 million babies (uncertainty range 12·3-18·1 million) were born preterm, 11·1\% of all livebirths worldwide, ranging from about 5\% in several European countries to 18\% in some African countries. More than 60\% of preterm babies were born in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where 52\% of the global livebirths occur. Preterm birth also affects rich countries, for example, {USA} has high rates and is one of the ten countries with the highest numbers of preterm births. Of the 65 countries with estimated time trends, only three (Croatia, Ecuador, and Estonia), had reduced preterm birth rates 1990-2010.
{INTERPRETATION}: The burden of preterm birth is substantial and is increasing in those regions with reliable data. Improved recording of all pregnancy outcomes and standard application of preterm definitions is important. We recommend the addition of a data-quality indicator of the per cent of all live preterm births that are under 28 weeks' gestation. Distinguishing preterm births that are spontaneous from those that are provider-initiated is important to monitor trends associated with increased caesarean sections. Rapid scale up of basic interventions could accelerate progress towards Millennium Development Goal 4 for child survival and beyond.

In the filter, the gyroscope bias error, orientation error, and magnetic disturbance error are estimated. The filter was tested under quasi-static and dynamic conditions with ferromagnetic materials close to the sensor module. The quasi-static experiments implied static positions and rotations around the three axes. In the dynamic experiments, three-dimensional rotations were performed near a metal tool case. The orientation estimated by the filter was compared with the orientation obtained with an optical reference system Vicon. Results show accurate and drift-free orientation estimates. The compensation results in a significant difference (p{\textless}0.01) between the orientation estimates with compensation of magnetic disturbances in comparison to no compensation or only gyroscopes. The average static error was 1.4/spl deg/ (standard deviation 0.4) in the magnetically disturbed experiments. The dynamic error was 2.6/spl deg/ root means square.},

	abstract = {conventional position and Orientation estimating filters lead to the development of simple and equally efficient algorithms. The extensive research in this area resulted in relatively simple and robust techniques. Explicit complementary filter and Gradient descent based algorithm are such examples of the computationally simple and still efficient algorithms which are applicable to low cost tri-gyroscopes and tri-accelerometers based inertial measurement units ({IMUs}) using quaternion representation. These orientation estimators fuse gyro output for high frequency estimation along with accelerometer output for low frequency attitude estimation. This paper evaluates the performance of aforementioned two algorithms using both simulated and experimental data acquired from {IMU}. Simulated data was generated for known orientation to validate the filters performance whereas for experimental data; {MPU}6050 {IMU} was used for different scenarios. The assessment is based on the root mean square error computation for both algorithms. Moreover, both algorithms are equipped with adjustable parameters (filter gains) which were exploited for a range of values in the quest for perfection.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Existing motor pattern assessment methods, such as digital cameras and optoelectronic systems, suffer from object obstruction and require complex setups. To overcome these drawbacks, this paper presents a novel approach for biomechanical evaluation of newborn motor skills development. Multi-sensor measurement system comprising pressure mattress and {IMUs} fixed on trunk and arms is proposed and used as alternative to existing methods. Observed advantages seem appealing for the focused field and in general. Combined use of pressure distribution data and kinematic information is important also for posture assessment, ulcer prevention, and non-invasive sleep pattern analysis of adults.
{METHODS}: Arm kinematic parameters, such as root-mean-square acceleration, spectral arc length of hand velocity profile, including arm workspace surface area, and travelled hand path are obtained with the multi-sensor measurement system and compared to normative motion capture data for evaluation of adequacy. Two {IMUs} per arm, only one {IMU} on upper arm, and only one {IMU} on forearm sensor placement options are studied to assess influence of system configuration on method precision. Combination of pressure mattress and {IMU} fixed on the trunk is used to measure trunk position (obtained from mat), rotation (from {IMUs}) and associated movements on surface (from both). Measurement system is first validated on spontaneous arm and trunk movements of a dedicated baby doll having realistic anthropometric characteristics of newborns. Next, parameters of movements in a healthy infant are obtained with pressure mattress, along with trunk and forearm {IMU} sensors to verify appropriateness of method and parameters.
{RESULTS}: Evaluation results confirm that full sensor set, comprising pressure mattress and two {IMUs} per arm is a reliable substitution to optoelectronic systems. Motor pattern parameter errors are under 10\% and kinematic estimation error is in range of 2 cm. Although, use of only forearm {IMU} is not providing best possible kinematic precision, the simplicity of use and still acceptable accuracy are convincing for frequent practical use. Measurements demonstrated system high mobility and usability.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Study results confirm adequacy of the proposed multi-sensor measurement system, indicating its enviable potential for accurate infant trunk posture and arm movement assessment.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Preterm birth is the second largest direct cause of child deaths in children younger than 5 years. Yet, data regarding preterm birth ({\textless}37 completed weeks of gestation) are not routinely collected by {UN} agencies, and no systematic country estimates nor time trend analyses have been done. We report worldwide, regional, and national estimates of preterm birth rates for 184 countries in 2010 with time trends for selected countries, and provide a quantitative assessment of the uncertainty surrounding these estimates.
{METHODS}: We assessed various data sources according to prespecified inclusion criteria. National Registries (563 datapoints, 51 countries), Reproductive Health Surveys (13 datapoints, eight countries), and studies identified through systematic searches and unpublished data (162 datapoints, 40 countries) were included. 55 countries submitted additional data during {WHO}'s country consultation process. For 13 countries with adequate quality and quantity of data, we estimated preterm birth rates using country-level loess regression for 2010. For 171 countries, two regional multilevel statistical models were developed to estimate preterm birth rates for 2010. We estimated time trends from 1990 to 2010 for 65 countries with reliable time trend data and more than 10,000 livebirths per year. We calculated uncertainty ranges for all countries.
{FINDINGS}: In 2010, an estimated 14·9 million babies (uncertainty range 12·3-18·1 million) were born preterm, 11·1\% of all livebirths worldwide, ranging from about 5\% in several European countries to 18\% in some African countries. More than 60\% of preterm babies were born in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where 52\% of the global livebirths occur. Preterm birth also affects rich countries, for example, {USA} has high rates and is one of the ten countries with the highest numbers of preterm births. Of the 65 countries with estimated time trends, only three (Croatia, Ecuador, and Estonia), had reduced preterm birth rates 1990-2010.
{INTERPRETATION}: The burden of preterm birth is substantial and is increasing in those regions with reliable data. Improved recording of all pregnancy outcomes and standard application of preterm definitions is important. We recommend the addition of a data-quality indicator of the per cent of all live preterm births that are under 28 weeks' gestation. Distinguishing preterm births that are spontaneous from those that are provider-initiated is important to monitor trends associated with increased caesarean sections. Rapid scale up of basic interventions could accelerate progress towards Millennium Development Goal 4 for child survival and beyond.

	doi = {10.1002/14651858.CD005495.pub4},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Infants born preterm are at increased risk of developing cognitive and motor impairment compared with infants born at term. Early developmental interventions have been provided in the clinical setting with the aim of improving overall functional outcomes for these infants. Long-term benefits of these programmes remain unclear.
{OBJECTIVES}: Primary objective To compare the effectiveness of early developmental intervention programmes provided post hospital discharge to prevent motor or cognitive impairment in preterm ({\textless} 37 weeks) infants versus standard medical follow-up of preterm infants at infancy (zero to {\textless} three years), preschool age (three to {\textless} five years), school age (five to {\textless} 18 years) and adulthood (≥ 18 years). Secondary objectives To perform subgroup analyses to determine the following.• Effects of gestational age, birth weight and brain injury (periventricular leukomalacia ({PVL})/intraventricular haemorrhage ({IVH})) on cognitive and motor outcomes when early intervention is compared with standard follow-up. ∘ Gestational age: {\textless} 28 weeks, 28 to {\textless} 32 weeks, 32 to {\textless} 37 weeks. ∘ Birth weight: {\textless} 1000 grams, 1000 to {\textless} 1500 grams, 1500 to {\textless} 2500 grams. ∘ Brain injury: absence or presence of grade {III} or grade {IV} {IVH} or cystic {PVL} (or both) or an abnormal ultrasound/magnetic resonance image ({MRI}) before initiation of the intervention.• Effects of interventions started during inpatient stay with a post-discharge component versus standard follow-up care.• Effects of interventions focused on the parent-infant relationship, infant development or both compared with standard follow-up care.To perform sensitivity analysis to identify the following.• Effects on motor and cognitive impairment when early developmental interventions are provided within high-quality randomised trials with low risk of bias for sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome measures and selective reporting bias.
{SEARCH} {METHODS}: The search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used to identify randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of early developmental interventions provided post hospital discharge. Two review authors independently searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ({CENTRAL}), {MEDLINE} Advanced, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature ({CINAHL}), {PsycINFO} and {EMBASE} (1966 to August 2015).
{SELECTION} {CRITERIA}: Studies included had to be randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of early developmental intervention programmes that began within the first 12 months of life for infants born before 37 weeks' gestational age. Interventions could commence on an inpatient basis but had to include a post-discharge component for inclusion in this review. Outcome measures were not prespecified, other than that they had to assess cognitive outcomes, motor outcomes or both. Rates of cerebral palsy were documented.
{DATA} {COLLECTION} {AND} {ANALYSIS}: Two independent review authors extracted and entered data. Cognitive and motor outcomes were pooled by four age groups: infancy (zero to {\textless} three years), preschool age (three to {\textless} five years), school age (five to {\textless} 18 years) and adulthood (≥ 18 years). Meta-analysis using {RevMan} 5.1 was carried out to determine the effects of early developmental interventions at each age range. Subgroup analyses focused on gestational age, birth weight, brain injury, commencement of the intervention, focus of the intervention and study quality.
{MAIN} {RESULTS}: Twenty-five studies met the inclusion criteria (3615 randomly assigned participants). Only 12 of these studies were randomised controlled trials with appropriate allocation concealment. Variability was evident with regard to focus and intensity of the intervention, participant characteristics and length of follow-up. Meta-analysis led to the conclusion that intervention improved cognitive outcomes at infancy (developmental quotient ({DQ}): standardised mean difference ({SMD}) 0.32 standard deviations ({SDs}), 95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 0.16 to 0.47; P value {\textless} 0.001; 16 studies; 2372 participants) and at preschool age (intelligence quotient ({IQ}); {SMD} 0.43 {SDs}, 95\% {CI} 0.32 to 0.54; P value {\textless} 0.001; eight studies; 1436 participants). However, this effect was not sustained at school age ({IQ}: {SMD} 0.18 {SDs}, 95\% {CI} -0.08 to 0.43; P value = 0.17; five studies; 1372 participants). Heterogeneity between studies for cognitive outcomes at infancy and at school age was significant. With regards to motor outcomes, meta-analysis of 12 studies showed a significant effect in favour of early developmental interventions at infancy only; however, this effect was small (motor scale {DQ}: {SMD} 0.10 {SDs}, 95\% {CI} 0.01 to 0.19; P value = 0.03; 12 studies; 1895 participants). No effect was noted on the rate of cerebral palsy among survivors (risk ratio ({RR}) 0.82, 95\% {CI} 0.52 to 1.27; seven studies; 985 participants). Little evidence showed a positive effect on motor outcomes in the long term, but only five included studies reported outcomes at preschool age (n = 3) or at school age (n = 2).
{AUTHORS}' {CONCLUSIONS}: Early intervention programmes for preterm infants have a positive influence on cognitive and motor outcomes during infancy, with cognitive benefits persisting into preschool age. A great deal of heterogeneity between studies was due to the variety of early developmental intervention programmes tested and to gestational ages of included preterm infants; thus, comparisons of intervention programmes were limited. Further research is needed to determine which early developmental interventions are most effective in improving cognitive and motor outcomes, and to discern the longer-term effects of these programmes.},

{METHOD}: Randomized controlled trials ({RCTs}) or quasi-{RCTs} of early developmental intervention programmes for preterm infants in which motor or cognitive outcomes were reported and in which the intervention commenced before or after discharge were included. A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies grouped by intervention, age of outcome, and study quality was undertaken. Databases searched (up to January 2009) included the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, {MEDLINE}, {CINAHL}, {PsycINFO}, and Embase.
{RESULTS}: Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria (2686 patients randomized), but only 11 studies had data suitable for meta-analysis. Early developmental intervention improved cognitive outcomes at infant age (developmental quotient: standardized mean difference [{SMD}] 0.42, 95\% confidence interval [{CI}] 0.33-0.52; p{\textless}0.001), and at preschool age ({IQ}: {SMD} 0.46, 95\% {CI} 0.33-0.59; p{\textless}0.001). However, the benefit was not sustained at school age ({IQ}: {SMD} 0.02, 95\% {CI} -0.10 to 0.14; p=0.71). Early intervention had little effect on motor outcome at infant or school age, and there was no study reporting motor outcome at preschool age.
{INTERPRETATION}: Current evidence suggests that the benefits of developmental intervention postdischarge are restricted to short-term gains in cognitive outcome.},

	isbn = {978-0-8058-5163-2},
	abstract = {Why include a chapter about physical and motor development in a book about developmental science? What is psychological about the body in motion? The answer is twofold. First, motor development is more than a list of developmental norms on a growth chart or a screening inventory. Motor behavior is integral to psychology. For those psychologists who believe that psychology is the study of behavior, movement is the stuff of the science. Behavior is movement. Infants' visual exploration of events, smiles and babbles to caregivers, manipulation of objects, and navigation of the environment involve movements of the eyes, mouth, arms, and legs. Alternatively, for those psychologists who believe that psychology is the study of mind, infants' movements are the medium for making inferences about thoughts, perceptions, and intentions that are not directly observable. Researchers rely on movements to study infants who cannot understand verbal questions or respond with spoken answers. Eye movements, smiles and cries, reaching, kicking, and walking are essential tools for studying infants' perception, cognition, emotion, and social interaction. Second, and perhaps more important, adaptive control of movement is a psychological problem in itself (Bertenthal \& Clifton, 1998). Motor action is inextricably coupled with perception, and motor development is implicated in the development of cognition and emotion. Burgeoning motor skills provide infants with new opportunities for learning. As Piaget (1954) pointed out, sensorimotor behavior is the fodder for cognition. This chapter focuses on the development of motor action in the fetal and infancy periods. ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2023 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

These measures can be grouped into the categories of pathogenesis, impairment, and functional limitation. Neuroimaging techniques are the most predictive measures of pathogenesis of cerebral palsy in both the preterm and term infant. Measures of neurological impairment focusing on muscle tone, reflexes, and other features of the neurological examination are poorly predictive in the first months of life. Detection of functional limitations manifested by motor developmental delay is sensitive and specific for later cerebral palsy, but not until well into the second 6 months of life. Abnormal spontaneous general movements in the infant 16 to 20 weeks postterm and earlier reflect functional limitations in the first months of life and have been shown to predict later cerebral palsy. Recognition of abnormal spontaneous general movements may improve early detection and diagnosis of cerebral palsy if these techniques can be successfully incorporated into organized follow-up programs and developmental surveillance.},

	abstract = {This systematic review evaluates assessments used to discriminate, predict, or evaluate the motor development of preterm infants during the first year of life. Eighteen assessments were identified; nine met the inclusion criteria. The Alberta Infant Motor Scale ({AIMS}), Bayley Scale of Infant and Toddler Development -- Version {III}, Peabody Developmental Motor Scales -- Version 2, Test of Infant Motor Performance ({TIMP}), and Toddler and Infant Motor Examination have good discriminative validity when examined in large populations. The {AIMS}, Prechtl's Assessment of General Movements ({GMs}), Neuro Sensory Motor Development Assessment ({NSMDA}), and {TIMP} were designed for preterm infants and are able to detect more subtle changes in movement quality. The best predictive assessment tools are age dependent: {GMs}, the Movement Assessment of Infants, and {TIMP} are strongest in early infancy (age 4 mo or less) and the {AIMS} and {NSMDA} are better at older ages (8-12 mo). The {TIMP} is the only tool that has demonstrated a difference between groups in response to intervention in two randomized controlled trials. The {AIMS}, {TIMP}, and {GMs} demonstrated the highest levels of overall reliability (interrater and intrarater intraclass correlation coefficient or kappa{\textgreater}0.85). Selection of motor assessment tools during the first year of life for infants born preterm will depend on the intended purpose of their use for discrimination, prediction, and/or evaluation.},

are significantly associated with age in cohorts of typical and at-risk infantsdiffer significantly at 5–6 months of age, depending on the context: relating either with an object or a person.Environmental and developmental factors shape the developmental trajectories of hand movements in different cohorts: environment for infants with {VIMs}; stage of development for premature infants and those with West syndrome; and both factors for infants with orality disorders.The curvature of hand movements specifically reflects atypical development in infants with West syndrome when developmental age is considered.We aimed to discriminate between typical and atypical developmental trajectory patterns of at-risk infants in an interactive setting in this observational and longitudinal study, with the assumption that hand movements ({HM}) reflect preverbal communication and its disorders. We examined the developmental trajectories of {HM} in five cohorts of at-risk infants and one control cohort, followed from ages 2 to 10 months: 25 West syndrome ({WS}), 13 preterm birth ({PB}), 16 orality disorder ({OD}), 14 with visually impaired mothers ({VIM}), 7 early hospitalization ({EH}), and 19 typically developing infants ({TD}). Video-recorded data were collected in three different structured interactive contexts. Descriptors of the hand motion were used to examine the extent to which {HM} were associated with age and cohort. We obtained four principal results: (i) the kinematics of {HM} (spatial use, curvature, acceleration, and velocity) were significantly associated with age in all cohorts; (ii) {HM} significantly differed at 5–6 months of age in {TD} infants, depending on the context; (iii) environmental and developmental factors shaped the developmental trajectories of {HM} in different cohorts: environment for {VIM}, development for {PB} and {WS}, and both factors for {OD} and; (iv) the curvatures of {HM} showed atypical development in {WS} infants when developmental age was considered. These findings support the importance of using kinematics of {HM} to identify very early developmental disorders in an interactive context and would allow early prevention and intervention for at-risk infants.},

The sensors are used consist of Inertial Measurement Unit (a 3- axis gyroscope with uncompensated bias and a 3-axis accelerometer) and a 3-axis magnetometer. To improve the accuracy of attitude estimation an extended Kalman filter ({EKF}) with a switching rule is used to fuse the sensory information. In practical applications, under the external acceleration, the output of accelerometer is not reliable due to its sensivity to vibration and non-separability the dynamic acceleration and gravity. To overcome this problem a switching rule is designed based on acceleration detection. If external acceleration is detected in rigid body movement, only magnetometer outputs will be used in {EKF} equations; otherwise, both of the accelerometer and magnetometer outputs will be employed. Through numerical simulations, the efficiency of the proposed method is illustrated under external acceleration.},

Forty healthy infants were positioned in supine, prone and side-lying positions so that frequency and duration of the behaviors were quantified. Postural control when in supine and prone was also analyzed. The prone position elicited hand-mouth behavior in 0-2-month-old infants. The side-lying position elicited hand-mouth behavior in 3-4-month-old infants and hand-hand behavior in 2-4-month-olds. The increased postural control promoted the emergence of hand-hand behavior when in supine, and decreased hand-mouth behavior when in prone.

All but one infant were unimanual reachers at 5 months of age. Preferential reaching was space dependent rather than object dependent at this stage. Children reaching for objects in the right hemispace predominantly with their right hand showed a significantly greater right hand laterality at late preschool age than children who at the age of 5 months had shown inconsistent hand use (p {\textless} .05). Children who at the age of 5 months had reached for objects in the left hemispace with their left hand proved to be less lateralized in their right hand use approximately 5 years later (p {\textless} .05).},

	abstract = {The "ba, ba, ba" sound universal to babies' babbling around 7 months captures scientific attention because it provides insights into the mechanisms underlying language acquisition and vestiges of its evolutionary origins. Yet the prevailing mystery is what is the biological basis of babbling, with one hypothesis being that it is a non-linguistic motoric activity driven largely by the baby's emerging control over the mouth and jaw, and another being that it is a linguistic activity reflecting the babies' early sensitivity to specific phonetic-syllabic patterns. Two groups of hearing babies were studied over time (ages 6, 10, and 12 months), equal in all developmental respects except for the modality of language input (mouth versus hand): three hearing babies acquiring spoken language (group 1: "speech-exposed") and a rare group of three hearing babies acquiring sign language only, not speech (group 2: "sign-exposed"). Despite this latter group's exposure to sign, the motoric hypothesis would predict similar hand activity to that seen in speech-exposed hearing babies because language acquisition in sign-exposed babies does not involve the mouth. Using innovative quantitative Optotrak 3-D motion-tracking technology, applied here for the first time to study infant language acquisition, we obtained physical measurements similar to a speech spectrogram, but for the hands. Here we discovered that the specific rhythmic frequencies of the hands of the sign-exposed hearing babies differed depending on whether they were producing linguistic activity, which they produced at a low frequency of approximately 1 Hz, versus non-linguistic activity, which they produced at a higher frequency of approximately 2.5 Hz - the identical class of hand activity that the speech-exposed hearing babies produced nearly exclusively. Surprisingly, without benefit of the mouth, hearing sign-exposed babies alone babbled systematically on their hands. We conclude that babbling is fundamentally a linguistic activity and explain why the differentiation between linguistic and non-linguistic hand activity in a single manual modality (one distinct from the human mouth) could only have resulted if all babies are born with a sensitivity to specific rhythmic patterns at the heart of human language and the capacity to use them.},

Each assessment consisted of simultaneous recording of video-data and surface {EMGs} of arm, neck, trunk, and leg muscles in various lying and sitting positions. Additionally, postural adjustments during spontaneous arm movements were studied in a second group of five infants aged 1-3 months. Already before the onset of successful reaching, which occurred at 4 5 months, both spontaneous and goal-directed arm movements were accompanied by a high amount of postural activity. During the goal-directed arm movements a preference for neck muscle activation and a direction specific organisation (dorsal postural muscles activated before the ventral antagonists) prevailed, whereas during spontaneous arm movements such a specific postural organisation was absent. With increasing age and concurrent with successful reaching, the amount of postural activity decreased. Still, the persisting postural activity continued to become more organised with increasing age. Position affected the postural adjustments accompanying goal-directed arm movements at all ages.},

	abstract = {Adequate postural control is a prerequisite for daily activities such as reaching for an object. However, knowledge on the relationship between postural adjustments and the quality of reaching movements during human ontogeny is scarce. Therefore we evaluated the development of the relationship between the kinematic features of reaching movements and the accompanying postural adjustments in young infants. Twelve typically developing ({TD}) infants were assessed twice, i.e. at 4 and 6 months of age, in supine and supported sitting position. Reaching was elicited by presenting toys in the midline at an arm-length distance while simultaneously surface {EMG}-activity was recorded from multiple arm-, neck-, trunk- and leg muscles. Concurrently kinematics of reaching were recorded with an {ELITE} system; kinematic analysis was restricted to the behaviour of so-called movement units, which are sub movements of reaching determined with the help of peaks in the velocity profile of the hand, maximum movement velocity and movement duration. A computer-algorithm determined significant phasic muscle activity. Activity in neck and trunk muscles (postural activity) was related to the onset of the prime mover, which was the arm muscle being activated first. The results indicated that about 50\% of reaching movements in lying and sitting infants aged 4 and 6 months were accompanied by direction-specific postural adjustments. At 4 months variation dominated, but at 6 months a preference to recruit muscles in a top-down order (during sitting) and in the configuration of the complete pattern, i.e. the pattern in which all dorsal neck- and trunk muscles are activated in concert, (both conditions) emerged. Interestingly, the postural characteristics such as the presence of direction-specificity, recruitment of the complete pattern and top-down recruitment, were related to how successful the reaching was and the kinematics of reaching. It was concluded that the presence of direction-specific activity is not a prerequisite for the emergence of reaching movements. Nevertheless, already from 4 months onwards a better postural control is associated with a larger success and a better quality of reaching.},

We propose the "dislocation distance" as a novel method to quantify sensor displacement and to detect gradual and sudden changes of sensor orientation. Furthermore a method to define a so called fixed technical frame is proposed as a robust reference frame which can adapt to a new sensor orientation on the skin. The proposed methods are applied to quantify the effects of sensor displacement of 120 upper and lower limb movement recordings of newborns revealing the need for a method to compensate for sensor displacement. The reliability of the fixed technical frame is quantified and it is shown that trend and dispersion of the dislocation distance can be significantly reduced. A working example illustrates the consequences of sensor displacement on derived angle time series and how they are avoided using the fixed technical frame.},

In this study, the characteristics of spontaneous upper-extremity movements of premature infants with brain injuries and those without brain injuries were examined with time series analysis., Subjects: Participants were 7 premature infants with brain injuries and 7 matched, low-risk, premature infants at the age of 1 month after term., Methods: A triaxial accelerometer was used to measure upper-extremity limb acceleration in 3-dimensional space. Acceleration signals were recorded from the right wrist when the infant was in an active, alert state and lying in the supine position. The recording time was 200 seconds. The acceleration signal was sampled at a rate of 200 Hz. The acceleration time series data were analyzed by nonlinear analysis as well as linear analysis., Results: The nonlinear time series analysis indicated that spontaneous movements of premature infants have nonlinear, chaotic, dynamic characteristics. The movements of the infants with brain injuries were characterized by larger dimensionality, and they were more unstable and unpredictable than those of infants without brain injuries., Discussion and Conclusion: As determined by nonlinear analysis, the spontaneous movements of the premature infants with brain injuries had the characteristics of increased disorganization compared with those of the infants without brain injuries. Infants with brain injuries may manifest problems with self-organization as a function of the coordination of subsystems. Physical therapists should be able to support interactions among the subsystems and promote self-organization of motor learning through the individualized provision of various sensorimotor experiences for infants.},

Participants were 8 healthy full-term newborn infants (3 boys, 5 girls, mean birth weight and gestational age were 3070.6 g and 39 weeks). A tri-axial accelerometer measured limb movement acceleration in 3-dimensional space. Movement acceleration signals were recorded during 200 s from just below the ankle when the infant was in an active alert state and lying supine (sampling rate 200 Hz). Data were analyzed linearly and nonlinearly. As a result, the optimal embedding dimension showed more than 5 at all times. Time dependent changes started at 6 or 7, and over the next four months decreased to 5 and from 6 months old, increased. The maximal Lyapnov exponent was positive for all segments. The mutual information is at its greatest range at 0 months. Between 3 and 4 months the range in results is narrowest and lowest in value. The mean coefficient of correlation for the x-axis component was negative and y-axis component changed to a positive value between 1 month old and 4 months old. Nonlinear time series analysis suggested that newborn and young infants' spontaneous lower extremity movements are characterized by a nonlinear chaotic dynamics with 5 to 7 embedding dimensions. Developmental changes of an optimal embedding dimension showed a U-shaped phenomenon. In addition, the maximal Lyapnov exponents were positive for all segments (0.79-2.99). Infants' spontaneous movement involves chaotic dynamic systems that are capable of generating voluntary skill movements.},

	doi = {10.1109/TIM.2012.2187360},
	abstract = {Inexpensive inertial/magnetic measurement units can be found in numerous applications and are typically used to determine orientation. Due to the presence of nonidealities in measurement systems, the calibration of the sensor is thus needed to determine sensor parameters such as bias, misalignment, and gain/sensitivity. In this paper, an online automatic calibration method for a three-axial accelerometer is presented. Parameters are estimated using an unscented Kalman filter. The sensor is placed in a number of different orientations using a robotic arm. These orientations are calculated online from the parameter covariance matrix and represent estimated optimal sensor orientations for parameter estimation. Numerous simulations are run to evaluate the proposed calibration method, and a comparison is made with an offline least mean squares calibration method. The simulation results show that calibration with the proposed method results in higher accuracy of parameter estimation when using less than 100 iterations. The proposed calibration method is also applied to a real accelerometer using a low number of iterations. The results show only slight (less than 0.4\%) changes in parameter values between different calibration runs. The proposed calibration method provides an accurate parameter estimation using a small number of iterations without the need for manually predefining orientations of the sensor, and the method can be used in combination with other offline calibration methods to achieve even higher accuracy.},

The proposed system uses a combination of non-invasive sensors to assess and report sleep patterns: a contact-based pressure mattress and a non-contact 3D image acquisition device, which can complement each other. To evaluate our system, we used real data collected in Heracleia Lab’s assistive living apartment.

	abstract = {Background
Existing motor pattern assessment methods, such as digital cameras and optoelectronic systems, suffer from object obstruction and require complex setups. To overcome these drawbacks, this paper presents a novel approach for biomechanical evaluation of newborn motor skills development. Multi-sensor measurement system comprising pressure mattress and {IMUs} fixed on trunk and arms is proposed and used as alternative to existing methods. Observed advantages seem appealing for the focused field and in general. Combined use of pressure distribution data and kinematic information is important also for posture assessment, ulcer prevention, and non-invasive sleep pattern analysis of adults.

Methods
Arm kinematic parameters, such as root-mean-square acceleration, spectral arc length of hand velocity profile, including arm workspace surface area, and travelled hand path are obtained with the multi-sensor measurement system and compared to normative motion capture data for evaluation of adequacy. Two {IMUs} per arm, only one {IMU} on upper arm, and only one {IMU} on forearm sensor placement options are studied to assess influence of system configuration on method precision. Combination of pressure mattress and {IMU} fixed on the trunk is used to measure trunk position (obtained from mat), rotation (from {IMUs}) and associated movements on surface (from both). Measurement system is first validated on spontaneous arm and trunk movements of a dedicated baby doll having realistic anthropometric characteristics of newborns. Next, parameters of movements in a healthy infant are obtained with pressure mattress, along with trunk and forearm {IMU} sensors to verify appropriateness of method and parameters.

Results
Evaluation results confirm that full sensor set, comprising pressure mattress and two {IMUs} per arm is a reliable substitution to optoelectronic systems. Motor pattern parameter errors are under 10\% and kinematic estimation error is in range of 2 cm. Although, use of only forearm {IMU} is not providing best possible kinematic precision, the simplicity of use and still acceptable accuracy are convincing for frequent practical use. Measurements demonstrated system high mobility and usability.

Conclusions
Study results confirm adequacy of the proposed multi-sensor measurement system, indicating its enviable potential for accurate infant trunk posture and arm movement assessment.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Preterm birth is the second largest direct cause of child deaths in children younger than 5 years. Yet, data regarding preterm birth ({\textless}37 completed weeks of gestation) are not routinely collected by {UN} agencies, and no systematic country estimates nor time trend analyses have been done. We report worldwide, regional, and national estimates of preterm birth rates for 184 countries in 2010 with time trends for selected countries, and provide a quantitative assessment of the uncertainty surrounding these estimates.
{METHODS}: We assessed various data sources according to prespecified inclusion criteria. National Registries (563 datapoints, 51 countries), Reproductive Health Surveys (13 datapoints, eight countries), and studies identified through systematic searches and unpublished data (162 datapoints, 40 countries) were included. 55 countries submitted additional data during {WHO}'s country consultation process. For 13 countries with adequate quality and quantity of data, we estimated preterm birth rates using country-level loess regression for 2010. For 171 countries, two regional multilevel statistical models were developed to estimate preterm birth rates for 2010. We estimated time trends from 1990 to 2010 for 65 countries with reliable time trend data and more than 10,000 livebirths per year. We calculated uncertainty ranges for all countries.
{FINDINGS}: In 2010, an estimated 14·9 million babies (uncertainty range 12·3-18·1 million) were born preterm, 11·1\% of all livebirths worldwide, ranging from about 5\% in several European countries to 18\% in some African countries. More than 60\% of preterm babies were born in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where 52\% of the global livebirths occur. Preterm birth also affects rich countries, for example, {USA} has high rates and is one of the ten countries with the highest numbers of preterm births. Of the 65 countries with estimated time trends, only three (Croatia, Ecuador, and Estonia), had reduced preterm birth rates 1990-2010.
{INTERPRETATION}: The burden of preterm birth is substantial and is increasing in those regions with reliable data. Improved recording of all pregnancy outcomes and standard application of preterm definitions is important. We recommend the addition of a data-quality indicator of the per cent of all live preterm births that are under 28 weeks' gestation. Distinguishing preterm births that are spontaneous from those that are provider-initiated is important to monitor trends associated with increased caesarean sections. Rapid scale up of basic interventions could accelerate progress towards Millennium Development Goal 4 for child survival and beyond.

	doi = {10.1002/14651858.CD005495.pub4},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Infants born preterm are at increased risk of developing cognitive and motor impairment compared with infants born at term. Early developmental interventions have been provided in the clinical setting with the aim of improving overall functional outcomes for these infants. Long-term benefits of these programmes remain unclear.
{OBJECTIVES}: Primary objective To compare the effectiveness of early developmental intervention programmes provided post hospital discharge to prevent motor or cognitive impairment in preterm ({\textless} 37 weeks) infants versus standard medical follow-up of preterm infants at infancy (zero to {\textless} three years), preschool age (three to {\textless} five years), school age (five to {\textless} 18 years) and adulthood (≥ 18 years). Secondary objectives To perform subgroup analyses to determine the following.• Effects of gestational age, birth weight and brain injury (periventricular leukomalacia ({PVL})/intraventricular haemorrhage ({IVH})) on cognitive and motor outcomes when early intervention is compared with standard follow-up. ∘ Gestational age: {\textless} 28 weeks, 28 to {\textless} 32 weeks, 32 to {\textless} 37 weeks. ∘ Birth weight: {\textless} 1000 grams, 1000 to {\textless} 1500 grams, 1500 to {\textless} 2500 grams. ∘ Brain injury: absence or presence of grade {III} or grade {IV} {IVH} or cystic {PVL} (or both) or an abnormal ultrasound/magnetic resonance image ({MRI}) before initiation of the intervention.• Effects of interventions started during inpatient stay with a post-discharge component versus standard follow-up care.• Effects of interventions focused on the parent-infant relationship, infant development or both compared with standard follow-up care.To perform sensitivity analysis to identify the following.• Effects on motor and cognitive impairment when early developmental interventions are provided within high-quality randomised trials with low risk of bias for sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome measures and selective reporting bias.
{SEARCH} {METHODS}: The search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used to identify randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of early developmental interventions provided post hospital discharge. Two review authors independently searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ({CENTRAL}), {MEDLINE} Advanced, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature ({CINAHL}), {PsycINFO} and {EMBASE} (1966 to August 2015).
{SELECTION} {CRITERIA}: Studies included had to be randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of early developmental intervention programmes that began within the first 12 months of life for infants born before 37 weeks' gestational age. Interventions could commence on an inpatient basis but had to include a post-discharge component for inclusion in this review. Outcome measures were not prespecified, other than that they had to assess cognitive outcomes, motor outcomes or both. Rates of cerebral palsy were documented.
{DATA} {COLLECTION} {AND} {ANALYSIS}: Two independent review authors extracted and entered data. Cognitive and motor outcomes were pooled by four age groups: infancy (zero to {\textless} three years), preschool age (three to {\textless} five years), school age (five to {\textless} 18 years) and adulthood (≥ 18 years). Meta-analysis using {RevMan} 5.1 was carried out to determine the effects of early developmental interventions at each age range. Subgroup analyses focused on gestational age, birth weight, brain injury, commencement of the intervention, focus of the intervention and study quality.
{MAIN} {RESULTS}: Twenty-five studies met the inclusion criteria (3615 randomly assigned participants). Only 12 of these studies were randomised controlled trials with appropriate allocation concealment. Variability was evident with regard to focus and intensity of the intervention, participant characteristics and length of follow-up. Meta-analysis led to the conclusion that intervention improved cognitive outcomes at infancy (developmental quotient ({DQ}): standardised mean difference ({SMD}) 0.32 standard deviations ({SDs}), 95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 0.16 to 0.47; P value {\textless} 0.001; 16 studies; 2372 participants) and at preschool age (intelligence quotient ({IQ}); {SMD} 0.43 {SDs}, 95\% {CI} 0.32 to 0.54; P value {\textless} 0.001; eight studies; 1436 participants). However, this effect was not sustained at school age ({IQ}: {SMD} 0.18 {SDs}, 95\% {CI} -0.08 to 0.43; P value = 0.17; five studies; 1372 participants). Heterogeneity between studies for cognitive outcomes at infancy and at school age was significant. With regards to motor outcomes, meta-analysis of 12 studies showed a significant effect in favour of early developmental interventions at infancy only; however, this effect was small (motor scale {DQ}: {SMD} 0.10 {SDs}, 95\% {CI} 0.01 to 0.19; P value = 0.03; 12 studies; 1895 participants). No effect was noted on the rate of cerebral palsy among survivors (risk ratio ({RR}) 0.82, 95\% {CI} 0.52 to 1.27; seven studies; 985 participants). Little evidence showed a positive effect on motor outcomes in the long term, but only five included studies reported outcomes at preschool age (n = 3) or at school age (n = 2).
{AUTHORS}' {CONCLUSIONS}: Early intervention programmes for preterm infants have a positive influence on cognitive and motor outcomes during infancy, with cognitive benefits persisting into preschool age. A great deal of heterogeneity between studies was due to the variety of early developmental intervention programmes tested and to gestational ages of included preterm infants; thus, comparisons of intervention programmes were limited. Further research is needed to determine which early developmental interventions are most effective in improving cognitive and motor outcomes, and to discern the longer-term effects of these programmes.},

{RESULTS}: Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria (2686 patients randomized), but only 11 studies had data suitable for meta-analysis. Early developmental intervention improved cognitive outcomes at infant age (developmental quotient: standardized mean difference [{SMD}] 0.42, 95\% confidence interval [{CI}] 0.33-0.52; p{\textless}0.001), and at preschool age ({IQ}: {SMD} 0.46, 95\% {CI} 0.33-0.59; p{\textless}0.001). However, the benefit was not sustained at school age ({IQ}: {SMD} 0.02, 95\% {CI} -0.10 to 0.14; p=0.71). Early intervention had little effect on motor outcome at infant or school age, and there was no study reporting motor outcome at preschool age.
{INTERPRETATION}: Current evidence suggests that the benefits of developmental intervention postdischarge are restricted to short-term gains in cognitive outcome.},

	isbn = {978-0-8058-5163-2},
	abstract = {Why include a chapter about physical and motor development in a book about developmental science? What is psychological about the body in motion? The answer is twofold. First, motor development is more than a list of developmental norms on a growth chart or a screening inventory. Motor behavior is integral to psychology. For those psychologists who believe that psychology is the study of behavior, movement is the stuff of the science. Behavior is movement. Infants' visual exploration of events, smiles and babbles to caregivers, manipulation of objects, and navigation of the environment involve movements of the eyes, mouth, arms, and legs. Alternatively, for those psychologists who believe that psychology is the study of mind, infants' movements are the medium for making inferences about thoughts, perceptions, and intentions that are not directly observable. Researchers rely on movements to study infants who cannot understand verbal questions or respond with spoken answers. Eye movements, smiles and cries, reaching, kicking, and walking are essential tools for studying infants' perception, cognition, emotion, and social interaction. Second, and perhaps more important, adaptive control of movement is a psychological problem in itself (Bertenthal \& Clifton, 1998). Motor action is inextricably coupled with perception, and motor development is implicated in the development of cognition and emotion. Burgeoning motor skills provide infants with new opportunities for learning. As Piaget (1954) pointed out, sensorimotor behavior is the fodder for cognition. This chapter focuses on the development of motor action in the fetal and infancy periods. ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2023 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

These measures can be grouped into the categories of pathogenesis, impairment, and functional limitation. Neuroimaging techniques are the most predictive measures of pathogenesis of cerebral palsy in both the preterm and term infant. Measures of neurological impairment focusing on muscle tone, reflexes, and other features of the neurological examination are poorly predictive in the first months of life. Detection of functional limitations manifested by motor developmental delay is sensitive and specific for later cerebral palsy, but not until well into the second 6 months of life. Abnormal spontaneous general movements in the infant 16 to 20 weeks postterm and earlier reflect functional limitations in the first months of life and have been shown to predict later cerebral palsy. Recognition of abnormal spontaneous general movements may improve early detection and diagnosis of cerebral palsy if these techniques can be successfully incorporated into organized follow-up programs and developmental surveillance.},

The Alberta Infant Motor Scale ({AIMS}), Bayley Scale of Infant and Toddler Development -- Version {III}, Peabody Developmental Motor Scales -- Version 2, Test of Infant Motor Performance ({TIMP}), and Toddler and Infant Motor Examination have good discriminative validity when examined in large populations. The {AIMS}, Prechtl's Assessment of General Movements ({GMs}), Neuro Sensory Motor Development Assessment ({NSMDA}), and {TIMP} were designed for preterm infants and are able to detect more subtle changes in movement quality. The best predictive assessment tools are age dependent: {GMs}, the Movement Assessment of Infants, and {TIMP} are strongest in early infancy (age 4 mo or less) and the {AIMS} and {NSMDA} are better at older ages (8-12 mo). The {TIMP} is the only tool that has demonstrated a difference between groups in response to intervention in two randomized controlled trials. The {AIMS}, {TIMP}, and {GMs} demonstrated the highest levels of overall reliability (interrater and intrarater intraclass correlation coefficient or kappa{\textgreater}0.85). Selection of motor assessment tools during the first year of life for infants born preterm will depend on the intended purpose of their use for discrimination, prediction, and/or evaluation.},

are significantly associated with age in cohorts of typical and at-risk infantsdiffer significantly at 5–6 months of age, depending on the context: relating either with an object or a person.Environmental and developmental factors shape the developmental trajectories of hand movements in different cohorts: environment for infants with {VIMs}; stage of development for premature infants and those with West syndrome; and both factors for infants with orality disorders.The curvature of hand movements specifically reflects atypical development in infants with West syndrome when developmental age is considered.We aimed to discriminate between typical and atypical developmental trajectory patterns of at-risk infants in an interactive setting in this observational and longitudinal study, with the assumption that hand movements ({HM}) reflect preverbal communication and its disorders. We examined the developmental trajectories of {HM} in five cohorts of at-risk infants and one control cohort, followed from ages 2 to 10 months: 25 West syndrome ({WS}), 13 preterm birth ({PB}), 16 orality disorder ({OD}), 14 with visually impaired mothers ({VIM}), 7 early hospitalization ({EH}), and 19 typically developing infants ({TD}). Video-recorded data were collected in three different structured interactive contexts. Descriptors of the hand motion were used to examine the extent to which {HM} were associated with age and cohort. We obtained four principal results: (i) the kinematics of {HM} (spatial use, curvature, acceleration, and velocity) were significantly associated with age in all cohorts; (ii) {HM} significantly differed at 5–6 months of age in {TD} infants, depending on the context; (iii) environmental and developmental factors shaped the developmental trajectories of {HM} in different cohorts: environment for {VIM}, development for {PB} and {WS}, and both factors for {OD} and; (iv) the curvatures of {HM} showed atypical development in {WS} infants when developmental age was considered. These findings support the importance of using kinematics of {HM} to identify very early developmental disorders in an interactive context and would allow early prevention and intervention for at-risk infants.},

The sensors are used consist of Inertial Measurement Unit (a 3- axis gyroscope with uncompensated bias and a 3-axis accelerometer) and a 3-axis magnetometer. To improve the accuracy of attitude estimation an extended Kalman filter ({EKF}) with a switching rule is used to fuse the sensory information. In practical applications, under the external acceleration, the output of accelerometer is not reliable due to its sensivity to vibration and non-separability the dynamic acceleration and gravity. To overcome this problem a switching rule is designed based on acceleration detection. If external acceleration is detected in rigid body movement, only magnetometer outputs will be used in {EKF} equations; otherwise, both of the accelerometer and magnetometer outputs will be employed. Through numerical simulations, the efficiency of the proposed method is illustrated under external acceleration.},

Most of the work on {GMA} has been performed from the same group of researchers. The aim of this study was to demonstrate to what extent {GMA} predicted {CP} in our hands.
{METHOD}: A prospective study was performed using the Prechtl classification system for {GMA} in the fidgety period to predict later cerebral palsy. The study population consisted of 74 term and preterm infants at low and high risk of developing neurological dysfunction. The absence or presence of {CP} was reported at 23 months median-corrected age by the child's physician and the parents.
{RESULTS}: The {GMA} identified all 10 infants that later were classified as having {CP}. {GMA} also identified all the infants that did not develop {CP} except for one infant with abnormal {GMA} and no {CP}. Three infants had uncertain {CP} status at follow-up. The sensitivity of {GMA} with regard to later {CP} was 100\% with 95\% {CI} (0.73, 1.00) and the specificity was 98\% with 95\% {CI} (0.91, 0.99) when the three uncertain cases were excluded.
{CONCLUSION}: Our study indicates that the {GMA} used in a clinical setting strongly predicts the development of {CP}. The work supports the results of previous studies and contributes to the validation of {GMA}. The qualitative nature of this method may be a problem for inexperienced observers. Larger clinical studies are needed.},

Results suggest a strong influence of the block shape, target location and movement number on the outcome measures.

Parent involvement in early intervention programs seems to have positive psychosocial effects on both the child and parent. {CareToy} is an innovative smart system that provides an intensive individualized home-based family-centred {EI} in preterm infants between 3 and 9 age-corrected months. A {RCT} study, preceded by a pilot study, has been recently carried out to evaluate the effects of {CareToy} intervention on neurodevelopmental outcomes with respect to Standard Care. This study aims at evaluating the effects of {CareToy} early intervention on parenting stress in preterm infants. Parents (mother and father) of a subgroup of infants enrolled in the {RCT} filled out a self-report questionnaire on parenting stress (Parenting Stress Index-Short Form ({PSI}-{SF})) before (T0) and after (T1) the {CareToy} or Standard Care period (4 weeks), according to the allocation of their preterm infant. For twins, an individual questionnaire for each one was filled out. Results obtained from mothers and fathers were separately analysed with nonparametric tests. 44 mothers and 44 fathers of 44 infants (24 {CareToy}/20 Standard Care) filled out the {PSI}-{SF} at T0 and at T1. {CareToy} intervention was mainly managed by mothers. A significant () reduction in Parental Distress subscale in the {CareToy} group versus Standard Care was found in the mothers. No differences were found among the fathers. {CareToy} training seems to be effective in reducing parental distress in mothers, who spent more time on {CareToy} intervention. These findings confirm the importance of parental involvement in early intervention programs. This trial is registered with Clinical Trial.gov {NCT}01990183.},

Intra- and interobserver agreement of the {IMP} were satisfactory (Spearman's rho=0.9). Concurrent validity of {IMP} and {AIMS} was good (Spearman's rho=0.8, p{\textless}0.005). The {IMP} was able to differentiate between infants with normal neurological condition, simple minor neurological dysfunction ({MND}), complex {MND}, and abnormal neurological condition (p{\textless}0.005). This means that the {IMP} may be a promising tool to evaluate neurological integrity during infancy, a suggestion that needs confirmation by means of assessment of larger groups of infants with heterogeneous neurological conditions.},

	abstract = {The study and measurement of grasping actions and forces in humans is important in a variety of contexts. In infants, it can give insights on the neuro-motor development and on pathological dysfunctions, while it poses functional and operative requirements that are not fully matched by current sensing technology. Novel approaches for measuring infants’ grasping actions are based on sensorized toys usable in natural settings. In this paper, we present a sensing device for measuring grasping force in 4–9-month-old infants. Starting from technical and clinical specifications, we designed and developed a novel device made by silicone, shaped as a ring toy and equipped with a pressure sensor, able to measure the pressure exerted by the infant's hand in the range of 0–5psi. A mechanical model of the material has been developed and tensile compression tests have been executed in order to assess the mechanical and electrical characteristics of the sensing device. The proposed device complies with the (technical and clinical) specifications and results suitable for measuring the grasping forces of the targeted infants, and finally for monitoring infants’ motor development. The theoretical model developed and the methodology for designing and characterizing the sensing device allow for easy re-design and adaptation of the sensing device and consideration of a variety of possible applications.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Preterm infants are at risk for neurodevelopmental disorders, including motor, cognitive or behavioural problems, which may potentially be modified by early intervention. The {EU} {CareToy} Project Consortium (http://www.caretoy.eu) has developed a new modular system for intensive, individualized, home-based and family-centred early intervention, managed remotely by rehabilitation staff. A randomised controlled trial ({RCT}) has been designed to evaluate the efficacy of {CareToy} training in a first sample of low-risk preterm infants.
{METHODS}/{DESIGN}: The trial, randomised, multi-center, evaluator-blinded, parallel group controlled, is designed according to {CONSORT} Statement. Eligible subjects are infants born preterm without major complications, aged 3-9 months of corrected age with specific gross-motor abilities defined by Ages \& Stages Questionnaire scores. Recruited infants, whose parents will sign a written informed consent for participation, will be randomized in {CareToy} training and control groups at baseline (T0). {CareToy} group will perform four weeks of personalized activities with the {CareToy} system, customized by the rehabilitation staff. The control group will continue standard care. Infant Motor Profile Scale is the primary outcome measure and a total sample size of 40 infants has been established. Bayley-Cognitive subscale, Alberta Infants Motor Scale and Teller Acuity Cards are secondary outcome measures. All measurements will be performed at T0 and at the end of training/control period (T1). For ethical reasons, after this first phase infants enrolled in the control group will perform the {CareToy} training, while the training group will continue standard care. At the end of open phase (T2) all infants will be assessed as at T1. Further assessment will be performed at 18 months corrected age (T3) to evaluate the long-term effects on neurodevelopmental outcome. Caregivers and rehabilitation staff will not be blinded whereas all the clinical assessments will be performed, videotaped and scored by blind assessors. The trial is ongoing and it is expected to be completed by April 2015.
{DISCUSSION}: This paper describes {RCT} methodology to evaluate {CareToy} as a new tool for early intervention in preterm infants, first contribution to test this new type of system. It presents background, hypotheses, outcome measures and trial methodology.

This narrative review also focuses on how the {AIMS} is applied as an outcome measure in research by presenting studies on the {AIMS} conducted over the last decade. Our review found that the {AIMS} is widely used for both research and clinical purposes. The {AIMS} has been used as an outcome measure in both interventional and observational studies conducted on both neurotypical infants and those with conditions affecting motor development. The advantages of the scale are its infant-friendliness, time duration of the examination, and relative ease of application for an examiner. The scale has been validated and standardized in many countries.},

However, the constellation of techniques required for scale development and evaluation can be onerous, jargon-filled, unfamiliar, and resource-intensive. Further, it is often not a part of graduate training. Therefore, our goal was to concisely review the process of scale development in as straightforward a manner as possible, both to facilitate the development of new, valid, and reliable scales, and to help improve existing ones. To do this, we have created a primer for best practices for scale development in measuring complex phenomena. This is not a systematic review, but rather the amalgamation of technical literature and lessons learned from our experiences spent creating or adapting a number of scales over the past several decades. We identified three phases that span nine steps. In the first phase, items are generated and the validity of their content is assessed. In the second phase, the scale is constructed. Steps in scale construction include pre-testing the questions, administering the survey, reducing the number of items, and understanding how many factors the scale captures. In the third phase, scale evaluation, the number of dimensions is tested, reliability is tested, and validity is assessed. We have also added examples of best practices to each step. In sum, this primer will equip both scientists and practitioners to understand the ontology and methodology of scale development and validation, thereby facilitating the advancement of our understanding of a range of health, social, and behavioral outcomes.},

{METHOD}: A prospective study was performed using the Prechtl classification system for {GMA} in the fidgety period to predict later cerebral palsy. The study population consisted of 74 term and preterm infants at low and high risk of developing neurological dysfunction. The absence or presence of {CP} was reported at 23 months median-corrected age by the child's physician and the parents.
{RESULTS}: The {GMA} identified all 10 infants that later were classified as having {CP}. {GMA} also identified all the infants that did not develop {CP} except for one infant with abnormal {GMA} and no {CP}. Three infants had uncertain {CP} status at follow-up. The sensitivity of {GMA} with regard to later {CP} was 100\% with 95\% {CI} (0.73, 1.00) and the specificity was 98\% with 95\% {CI} (0.91, 0.99) when the three uncertain cases were excluded.
{CONCLUSION}: Our study indicates that the {GMA} used in a clinical setting strongly predicts the development of {CP}. The work supports the results of previous studies and contributes to the validation of {GMA}. The qualitative nature of this method may be a problem for inexperienced observers. Larger clinical studies are needed.},

Low-cost force sensors located under the top lid and realtime data processing allowed us to accurately estimate the position of the block. The data extracted from these sensors was used to develop and calculate suitable outcome measures such as the average distance to the target, overall time to complete the task, percentage of time spent far from the target, average force applied to the lid and number of mistrials. Results suggest a strong influence of the block shape, target location and movement number on the outcome measures. The tool and measures will be used for early assessment of abnormal development of motor skills in infants and for evaluation of pathological conditions such as cerebral palsy.},

	abstract = {conventional position and Orientation estimating filters lead to the development of simple and equally efficient algorithms. The extensive research in this area resulted in relatively simple and robust techniques. Explicit complementary filter and Gradient descent based algorithm are such examples of the computationally simple and still efficient algorithms which are applicable to low cost tri-gyroscopes and tri-accelerometers based inertial measurement units ({IMUs}) using quaternion representation. These orientation estimators fuse gyro output for high frequency estimation along with accelerometer output for low frequency attitude estimation. This paper evaluates the performance of aforementioned two algorithms using both simulated and experimental data acquired from {IMU}. Simulated data was generated for known orientation to validate the filters performance whereas for experimental data; {MPU}6050 {IMU} was used for different scenarios. The assessment is based on the root mean square error computation for both algorithms. Moreover, both algorithms are equipped with adjustable parameters (filter gains) which were exploited for a range of values in the quest for perfection.},

In addition, it was adopted a {PD} controller to position the {UAV} in such points with predetermined orientations. Experiments involving abrupt maneuvers to induce errors in the estimation of position and orientation were carried out, to check the effectiveness of the developed 3D data capture system and the designed controller. Results show the success of the new approach integrating a data fusion system to estimate {UAV} position and orientation.},

	abstract = {In many robotic manipulator applications, the robot manipulator usually requires knowing the orientation of an object-of-interest to perform grasp planning. This paper presents a novel image-based object orientation estimation algorithm that efficiently and accurately estimates the orientation of a geometric object from vision information only. First, a boundary-point set is defined from the boundary of a geometric object in a segmented binary image. Next, a new objective function is proposed to evaluate the maximum projection length of the boundary-point set onto a closed set with respect to an orientation angle. Finally, the orientation information of the geometric object is estimated via a one-dimensional minimization process. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed method is able to provide accurate estimates for geometric objects with maximum absolute error less than 0.35°, which is enough to satisfy the requirement on robot grasping control tasks.},

Although methods using markers or machine learning have been developed, general-purpose and highly accurate estimations have not been realized. Our team developed a high-accuracy visual marker “{LentiMark}” for high-accuracy estimations of position and posture, but data are lost when the camera cannot obtain marker images. We therefore developed the Marker-{IMU} system for integrating visual markers with an inertia measurement unit ({IMU}). When cameras cannot acquire the image of a visual marker, any missing data are restored from {IMU} data. However, when calculating positions from acceleration sensor values, sensor error increases estimation error. Therefore, we developed a method for error correction using measurements from before and after the missing data. Evaluation experiments confirm that missing data can be estimated using the proposed method.},

At first, 2 or multiples of 2 active {RFID} tags as infrastructure landmarks are deployed along surrounding walls in a single indoor space or room. After the infrastructure landmarks are set up, the handheld indoor positioning device begins to connect to the Bluetooth-based {RFID} reader by pairing with Bluetooth {ID} of the {RFID} reader. Then, on the screen of the handheld indoor positioning device, red landmarks on the 2D indoor map represents pre-deployed active {RFID} tags. When moving, the targeted handheld indoor positioning device keeps estimating the relative location through external {RFID} infrastructure and keeps reckoning the inertial navigation through internal {IMU} module. Experimental results show these two proposed positioning methods, {RFID} Heron-bilateration location estimation and {IMU} angular-driven navigation reckoning, can cooperatively improve the accuracy and reliability of indoor positioning system further. Finally, the screen of the handheld indoor positioning device can show the location and orientation indications of the targeted user on the 2D indoor map accurately and immediately.},
