	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Preterm birth is the second largest direct cause of child deaths in children younger than 5 years. Yet, data regarding preterm birth ({\textless}37 completed weeks of gestation) are not routinely collected by {UN} agencies, and no systematic country estimates nor time trend analyses have been done. We report worldwide, regional, and national estimates of preterm birth rates for 184 countries in 2010 with time trends for selected countries, and provide a quantitative assessment of the uncertainty surrounding these estimates.
{METHODS}: We assessed various data sources according to prespecified inclusion criteria. National Registries (563 datapoints, 51 countries), Reproductive Health Surveys (13 datapoints, eight countries), and studies identified through systematic searches and unpublished data (162 datapoints, 40 countries) were included. 55 countries submitted additional data during {WHO}'s country consultation process. For 13 countries with adequate quality and quantity of data, we estimated preterm birth rates using country-level loess regression for 2010. For 171 countries, two regional multilevel statistical models were developed to estimate preterm birth rates for 2010. We estimated time trends from 1990 to 2010 for 65 countries with reliable time trend data and more than 10,000 livebirths per year. We calculated uncertainty ranges for all countries.
{FINDINGS}: In 2010, an estimated 14·9 million babies (uncertainty range 12·3-18·1 million) were born preterm, 11·1\% of all livebirths worldwide, ranging from about 5\% in several European countries to 18\% in some African countries. More than 60\% of preterm babies were born in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where 52\% of the global livebirths occur. Preterm birth also affects rich countries, for example, {USA} has high rates and is one of the ten countries with the highest numbers of preterm births. Of the 65 countries with estimated time trends, only three (Croatia, Ecuador, and Estonia), had reduced preterm birth rates 1990-2010.
{INTERPRETATION}: The burden of preterm birth is substantial and is increasing in those regions with reliable data. Improved recording of all pregnancy outcomes and standard application of preterm definitions is important. We recommend the addition of a data-quality indicator of the per cent of all live preterm births that are under 28 weeks' gestation. Distinguishing preterm births that are spontaneous from those that are provider-initiated is important to monitor trends associated with increased caesarean sections. Rapid scale up of basic interventions could accelerate progress towards Millennium Development Goal 4 for child survival and beyond.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Infants born preterm are at increased risk of developing cognitive and motor impairment compared with infants born at term. Early developmental interventions have been provided in the clinical setting with the aim of improving overall functional outcomes for these infants. Long-term benefits of these programmes remain unclear.
{OBJECTIVES}: Primary objective To compare the effectiveness of early developmental intervention programmes provided post hospital discharge to prevent motor or cognitive impairment in preterm ({\textless} 37 weeks) infants versus standard medical follow-up of preterm infants at infancy (zero to {\textless} three years), preschool age (three to {\textless} five years), school age (five to {\textless} 18 years) and adulthood (≥ 18 years). Secondary objectives To perform subgroup analyses to determine the following.• Effects of gestational age, birth weight and brain injury (periventricular leukomalacia ({PVL})/intraventricular haemorrhage ({IVH})) on cognitive and motor outcomes when early intervention is compared with standard follow-up. ∘ Gestational age: {\textless} 28 weeks, 28 to {\textless} 32 weeks, 32 to {\textless} 37 weeks. ∘ Birth weight: {\textless} 1000 grams, 1000 to {\textless} 1500 grams, 1500 to {\textless} 2500 grams. ∘ Brain injury: absence or presence of grade {III} or grade {IV} {IVH} or cystic {PVL} (or both) or an abnormal ultrasound/magnetic resonance image ({MRI}) before initiation of the intervention.• Effects of interventions started during inpatient stay with a post-discharge component versus standard follow-up care.• Effects of interventions focused on the parent-infant relationship, infant development or both compared with standard follow-up care.To perform sensitivity analysis to identify the following.• Effects on motor and cognitive impairment when early developmental interventions are provided within high-quality randomised trials with low risk of bias for sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome measures and selective reporting bias.
{SEARCH} {METHODS}: The search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used to identify randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of early developmental interventions provided post hospital discharge. Two review authors independently searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ({CENTRAL}), {MEDLINE} Advanced, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature ({CINAHL}), {PsycINFO} and {EMBASE} (1966 to August 2015).
{SELECTION} {CRITERIA}: Studies included had to be randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of early developmental intervention programmes that began within the first 12 months of life for infants born before 37 weeks' gestational age. Interventions could commence on an inpatient basis but had to include a post-discharge component for inclusion in this review. Outcome measures were not prespecified, other than that they had to assess cognitive outcomes, motor outcomes or both. Rates of cerebral palsy were documented.
{DATA} {COLLECTION} {AND} {ANALYSIS}: Two independent review authors extracted and entered data. Cognitive and motor outcomes were pooled by four age groups: infancy (zero to {\textless} three years), preschool age (three to {\textless} five years), school age (five to {\textless} 18 years) and adulthood (≥ 18 years). Meta-analysis using {RevMan} 5.1 was carried out to determine the effects of early developmental interventions at each age range. Subgroup analyses focused on gestational age, birth weight, brain injury, commencement of the intervention, focus of the intervention and study quality.
{MAIN} {RESULTS}: Twenty-five studies met the inclusion criteria (3615 randomly assigned participants). Only 12 of these studies were randomised controlled trials with appropriate allocation concealment. Variability was evident with regard to focus and intensity of the intervention, participant characteristics and length of follow-up. Meta-analysis led to the conclusion that intervention improved cognitive outcomes at infancy (developmental quotient ({DQ}): standardised mean difference ({SMD}) 0.32 standard deviations ({SDs}), 95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 0.16 to 0.47; P value {\textless} 0.001; 16 studies; 2372 participants) and at preschool age (intelligence quotient ({IQ}); {SMD} 0.43 {SDs}, 95\% {CI} 0.32 to 0.54; P value {\textless} 0.001; eight studies; 1436 participants). However, this effect was not sustained at school age ({IQ}: {SMD} 0.18 {SDs}, 95\% {CI} -0.08 to 0.43; P value = 0.17; five studies; 1372 participants). Heterogeneity between studies for cognitive outcomes at infancy and at school age was significant. With regards to motor outcomes, meta-analysis of 12 studies showed a significant effect in favour of early developmental interventions at infancy only; however, this effect was small (motor scale {DQ}: {SMD} 0.10 {SDs}, 95\% {CI} 0.01 to 0.19; P value = 0.03; 12 studies; 1895 participants). No effect was noted on the rate of cerebral palsy among survivors (risk ratio ({RR}) 0.82, 95\% {CI} 0.52 to 1.27; seven studies; 985 participants). Little evidence showed a positive effect on motor outcomes in the long term, but only five included studies reported outcomes at preschool age (n = 3) or at school age (n = 2).
{AUTHORS}' {CONCLUSIONS}: Early intervention programmes for preterm infants have a positive influence on cognitive and motor outcomes during infancy, with cognitive benefits persisting into preschool age. A great deal of heterogeneity between studies was due to the variety of early developmental intervention programmes tested and to gestational ages of included preterm infants; thus, comparisons of intervention programmes were limited. Further research is needed to determine which early developmental interventions are most effective in improving cognitive and motor outcomes, and to discern the longer-term effects of these programmes.},

	abstract = {{AIM}: The aim of this study was to review the effects of early developmental intervention after discharge from hospital on motor and cognitive development in preterm infants.
{METHOD}: Randomized controlled trials ({RCTs}) or quasi-{RCTs} of early developmental intervention programmes for preterm infants in which motor or cognitive outcomes were reported and in which the intervention commenced before or after discharge were included. A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies grouped by intervention, age of outcome, and study quality was undertaken. Databases searched (up to January 2009) included the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, {MEDLINE}, {CINAHL}, {PsycINFO}, and Embase.
{RESULTS}: Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria (2686 patients randomized), but only 11 studies had data suitable for meta-analysis. Early developmental intervention improved cognitive outcomes at infant age (developmental quotient: standardized mean difference [{SMD}] 0.42, 95\% confidence interval [{CI}] 0.33-0.52; p{\textless}0.001), and at preschool age ({IQ}: {SMD} 0.46, 95\% {CI} 0.33-0.59; p{\textless}0.001). However, the benefit was not sustained at school age ({IQ}: {SMD} 0.02, 95\% {CI} -0.10 to 0.14; p=0.71). Early intervention had little effect on motor outcome at infant or school age, and there was no study reporting motor outcome at preschool age.
{INTERPRETATION}: Current evidence suggests that the benefits of developmental intervention postdischarge are restricted to short-term gains in cognitive outcome.},

	isbn = {978-0-8058-5163-2},
	abstract = {Why include a chapter about physical and motor development in a book about developmental science? What is psychological about the body in motion? The answer is twofold. First, motor development is more than a list of developmental norms on a growth chart or a screening inventory. Motor behavior is integral to psychology. For those psychologists who believe that psychology is the study of behavior, movement is the stuff of the science. Behavior is movement. Infants' visual exploration of events, smiles and babbles to caregivers, manipulation of objects, and navigation of the environment involve movements of the eyes, mouth, arms, and legs. Alternatively, for those psychologists who believe that psychology is the study of mind, infants' movements are the medium for making inferences about thoughts, perceptions, and intentions that are not directly observable. Researchers rely on movements to study infants who cannot understand verbal questions or respond with spoken answers. Eye movements, smiles and cries, reaching, kicking, and walking are essential tools for studying infants' perception, cognition, emotion, and social interaction. Second, and perhaps more important, adaptive control of movement is a psychological problem in itself (Bertenthal \& Clifton, 1998). Motor action is inextricably coupled with perception, and motor development is implicated in the development of cognition and emotion. Burgeoning motor skills provide infants with new opportunities for learning. As Piaget (1954) pointed out, sensorimotor behavior is the fodder for cognition. This chapter focuses on the development of motor action in the fetal and infancy periods. ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2023 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {Abstract Strategies for the early detection and diagnosis of cerebral palsy include multiple measures of the underlying brain abnormalities and their neurodevelopmental consequences. These measures can be grouped into the categories of pathogenesis, impairment, and functional limitation. Neuroimaging techniques are the most predictive measures of pathogenesis of cerebral palsy in both the preterm and term infant. Measures of neurological impairment focusing on muscle tone, reflexes, and other features of the neurological examination are poorly predictive in the first months of life. Detection of functional limitations manifested by motor developmental delay is sensitive and specific for later cerebral palsy, but not until well into the second 6 months of life. Abnormal spontaneous general movements in the infant 16 to 20 weeks postterm and earlier reflect functional limitations in the first months of life and have been shown to predict later cerebral palsy. Recognition of abnormal spontaneous general movements may improve early detection and diagnosis of cerebral palsy if these techniques can be successfully incorporated into organized follow-up programs and developmental surveillance.},

We examined the developmental trajectories of {HM} in five cohorts of at-risk infants and one control cohort, followed from ages 2 to 10 months: 25 West syndrome ({WS}), 13 preterm birth ({PB}), 16 orality disorder ({OD}), 14 with visually impaired mothers ({VIM}), 7 early hospitalization ({EH}), and 19 typically developing infants ({TD}). Video-recorded data were collected in three different structured interactive contexts. Descriptors of the hand motion were used to examine the extent to which {HM} were associated with age and cohort. We obtained four principal results: (i) the kinematics of {HM} (spatial use, curvature, acceleration, and velocity) were significantly associated with age in all cohorts; (ii) {HM} significantly differed at 5–6 months of age in {TD} infants, depending on the context; (iii) environmental and developmental factors shaped the developmental trajectories of {HM} in different cohorts: environment for {VIM}, development for {PB} and {WS}, and both factors for {OD} and; (iv) the curvatures of {HM} showed atypical development in {WS} infants when developmental age was considered. These findings support the importance of using kinematics of {HM} to identify very early developmental disorders in an interactive context and would allow early prevention and intervention for at-risk infants.},

To improve the accuracy of attitude estimation an extended Kalman filter ({EKF}) with a switching rule is used to fuse the sensory information. In practical applications, under the external acceleration, the output of accelerometer is not reliable due to its sensivity to vibration and non-separability the dynamic acceleration and gravity. To overcome this problem a switching rule is designed based on acceleration detection. If external acceleration is detected in rigid body movement, only magnetometer outputs will be used in {EKF} equations; otherwise, both of the accelerometer and magnetometer outputs will be employed. Through numerical simulations, the efficiency of the proposed method is illustrated under external acceleration.},

Most of the work on {GMA} has been performed from the same group of researchers. The aim of this study was to demonstrate to what extent {GMA} predicted {CP} in our hands.
{METHOD}: A prospective study was performed using the Prechtl classification system for {GMA} in the fidgety period to predict later cerebral palsy. The study population consisted of 74 term and preterm infants at low and high risk of developing neurological dysfunction. The absence or presence of {CP} was reported at 23 months median-corrected age by the child's physician and the parents.
{RESULTS}: The {GMA} identified all 10 infants that later were classified as having {CP}. {GMA} also identified all the infants that did not develop {CP} except for one infant with abnormal {GMA} and no {CP}. Three infants had uncertain {CP} status at follow-up. The sensitivity of {GMA} with regard to later {CP} was 100\% with 95\% {CI} (0.73, 1.00) and the specificity was 98\% with 95\% {CI} (0.91, 0.99) when the three uncertain cases were excluded.
{CONCLUSION}: Our study indicates that the {GMA} used in a clinical setting strongly predicts the development of {CP}. The work supports the results of previous studies and contributes to the validation of {GMA}. The qualitative nature of this method may be a problem for inexperienced observers. Larger clinical studies are needed.},

	abstract = {Parenting a preterm infant is more challenging than a full-term one. Parent involvement in early intervention programs seems to have positive psychosocial effects on both the child and parent. {CareToy} is an innovative smart system that provides an intensive individualized home-based family-centred {EI} in preterm infants between 3 and 9 age-corrected months. A {RCT} study, preceded by a pilot study, has been recently carried out to evaluate the effects of {CareToy} intervention on neurodevelopmental outcomes with respect to Standard Care. This study aims at evaluating the effects of {CareToy} early intervention on parenting stress in preterm infants. Parents (mother and father) of a subgroup of infants enrolled in the {RCT} filled out a self-report questionnaire on parenting stress (Parenting Stress Index-Short Form ({PSI}-{SF})) before (T0) and after (T1) the {CareToy} or Standard Care period (4 weeks), according to the allocation of their preterm infant. For twins, an individual questionnaire for each one was filled out. Results obtained from mothers and fathers were separately analysed with nonparametric tests. 44 mothers and 44 fathers of 44 infants (24 {CareToy}/20 Standard Care) filled out the {PSI}-{SF} at T0 and at T1. {CareToy} intervention was mainly managed by mothers. A significant () reduction in Parental Distress subscale in the {CareToy} group versus Standard Care was found in the mothers. No differences were found among the fathers. {CareToy} training seems to be effective in reducing parental distress in mothers, who spent more time on {CareToy} intervention. These findings confirm the importance of parental involvement in early intervention programs. This trial is registered with Clinical Trial.gov {NCT}01990183.},

We developed a video-based assessment of motor behaviour, the Infant Motor Profile ({IMP}), to evaluate motor abilities, movement variability, ability to select motor strategies, movement symmetry, and fluency. The {IMP} consists of 80 items and is applicable in children from 3 to 18 months. The present study aimed to test intra- and interobserver reliability and concurrent validity of the {IMP} with the Alberta Infant Motor Scale ({AIMS}) and Touwen neurological examination. The study group consisted of 40 low-risk term (median gestational age [{GA}] 40 wks, range 38-42 wks) and 40 high-risk preterm infants (median {GA} 29.6 wks, range 26-33 wks) with corrected ages 4 to 18 months (31 females, 49 males). Intra- and interobserver agreement of the {IMP} were satisfactory (Spearman's rho=0.9). Concurrent validity of {IMP} and {AIMS} was good (Spearman's rho=0.8, p{\textless}0.005). The {IMP} was able to differentiate between infants with normal neurological condition, simple minor neurological dysfunction ({MND}), complex {MND}, and abnormal neurological condition (p{\textless}0.005). This means that the {IMP} may be a promising tool to evaluate neurological integrity during infancy, a suggestion that needs confirmation by means of assessment of larger groups of infants with heterogeneous neurological conditions.},

	abstract = {The study and measurement of grasping actions and forces in humans is important in a variety of contexts. In infants, it can give insights on the neuro-motor development and on pathological dysfunctions, while it poses functional and operative requirements that are not fully matched by current sensing technology. Novel approaches for measuring infants’ grasping actions are based on sensorized toys usable in natural settings. In this paper, we present a sensing device for measuring grasping force in 4–9-month-old infants. Starting from technical and clinical specifications, we designed and developed a novel device made by silicone, shaped as a ring toy and equipped with a pressure sensor, able to measure the pressure exerted by the infant's hand in the range of 0–5psi. A mechanical model of the material has been developed and tensile compression tests have been executed in order to assess the mechanical and electrical characteristics of the sensing device. The proposed device complies with the (technical and clinical) specifications and results suitable for measuring the grasping forces of the targeted infants, and finally for monitoring infants’ motor development. The theoretical model developed and the methodology for designing and characterizing the sensing device allow for easy re-design and adaptation of the sensing device and consideration of a variety of possible applications.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Preterm infants are at risk for neurodevelopmental disorders, including motor, cognitive or behavioural problems, which may potentially be modified by early intervention. The {EU} {CareToy} Project Consortium (http://www.caretoy.eu) has developed a new modular system for intensive, individualized, home-based and family-centred early intervention, managed remotely by rehabilitation staff. A randomised controlled trial ({RCT}) has been designed to evaluate the efficacy of {CareToy} training in a first sample of low-risk preterm infants.
{METHODS}/{DESIGN}: The trial, randomised, multi-center, evaluator-blinded, parallel group controlled, is designed according to {CONSORT} Statement. Eligible subjects are infants born preterm without major complications, aged 3-9 months of corrected age with specific gross-motor abilities defined by Ages \& Stages Questionnaire scores. Recruited infants, whose parents will sign a written informed consent for participation, will be randomized in {CareToy} training and control groups at baseline (T0). {CareToy} group will perform four weeks of personalized activities with the {CareToy} system, customized by the rehabilitation staff. The control group will continue standard care. Infant Motor Profile Scale is the primary outcome measure and a total sample size of 40 infants has been established. Bayley-Cognitive subscale, Alberta Infants Motor Scale and Teller Acuity Cards are secondary outcome measures. All measurements will be performed at T0 and at the end of training/control period (T1). For ethical reasons, after this first phase infants enrolled in the control group will perform the {CareToy} training, while the training group will continue standard care. At the end of open phase (T2) all infants will be assessed as at T1. Further assessment will be performed at 18 months corrected age (T3) to evaluate the long-term effects on neurodevelopmental outcome. Caregivers and rehabilitation staff will not be blinded whereas all the clinical assessments will be performed, videotaped and scored by blind assessors. The trial is ongoing and it is expected to be completed by April 2015.
{DISCUSSION}: This paper describes {RCT} methodology to evaluate {CareToy} as a new tool for early intervention in preterm infants, first contribution to test this new type of system. It presents background, hypotheses, outcome measures and trial methodology.

Based upon the literature, 58 items were generated and organized into four positions: prone, supine, sitting and standing. Each item describes three aspects of motor performance--weight-bearing, posture and antigravity movements. Content validation of the instrument was accomplished through a mail survey of Canadian pediatric physical therapists and consultation with an international panel of experts. Five hundred and six infants, age-stratified from birth through 18 months, participated in the reliability and validity testing of the {AIMS}. In addition, 20 infants who were experiencing abnormal motor development and 50 infants at risk for motor disorders were assessed and compared with the results of the full-term sample. Results to be presented include: 1) test-retest and inter-rater reliability estimates; 2) correlations between the {AIMS} and the Bayley and Peabody motor scores; and 3) scaling of the items along the age continuum for normal motor development.},

We conducted a non-systematic literature review using three electronic databases: {PubMed}, Scopus, and Embase (from June 1992 to February 2022). We included original research with a full-text manuscript in English. No geographical restrictions were applied. The search terms “alberta infant motor scale” {AND} “reliability” {OR} “validity” and “alberta infant motor scale” {AND} “norms” {OR} “reference” {OR} “standardization” were used for literature review on the validation and standardization of the {AIMS} in other non-Canadian populations. This narrative review also focuses on how the {AIMS} is applied as an outcome measure in research by presenting studies on the {AIMS} conducted over the last decade. Our review found that the {AIMS} is widely used for both research and clinical purposes. The {AIMS} has been used as an outcome measure in both interventional and observational studies conducted on both neurotypical infants and those with conditions affecting motor development. The advantages of the scale are its infant-friendliness, time duration of the examination, and relative ease of application for an examiner. The scale has been validated and standardized in many countries.},

However, the constellation of techniques required for scale development and evaluation can be onerous, jargon-filled, unfamiliar, and resource-intensive. Further, it is often not a part of graduate training. Therefore, our goal was to concisely review the process of scale development in as straightforward a manner as possible, both to facilitate the development of new, valid, and reliable scales, and to help improve existing ones. To do this, we have created a primer for best practices for scale development in measuring complex phenomena. This is not a systematic review, but rather the amalgamation of technical literature and lessons learned from our experiences spent creating or adapting a number of scales over the past several decades. We identified three phases that span nine steps. In the first phase, items are generated and the validity of their content is assessed. In the second phase, the scale is constructed. Steps in scale construction include pre-testing the questions, administering the survey, reducing the number of items, and understanding how many factors the scale captures. In the third phase, scale evaluation, the number of dimensions is tested, reliability is tested, and validity is assessed. We have also added examples of best practices to each step. In sum, this primer will equip both scientists and practitioners to understand the ontology and methodology of scale development and validation, thereby facilitating the advancement of our understanding of a range of health, social, and behavioral outcomes.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: The general movement assessment ({GMA}) method is used to predict cerebral palsy ({CP}) in infants with high risk of developing neurological dysfunctions. Most of the work on {GMA} has been performed from the same group of researchers. The aim of this study was to demonstrate to what extent {GMA} predicted {CP} in our hands.
{METHOD}: A prospective study was performed using the Prechtl classification system for {GMA} in the fidgety period to predict later cerebral palsy. The study population consisted of 74 term and preterm infants at low and high risk of developing neurological dysfunction. The absence or presence of {CP} was reported at 23 months median-corrected age by the child's physician and the parents.
{RESULTS}: The {GMA} identified all 10 infants that later were classified as having {CP}. {GMA} also identified all the infants that did not develop {CP} except for one infant with abnormal {GMA} and no {CP}. Three infants had uncertain {CP} status at follow-up. The sensitivity of {GMA} with regard to later {CP} was 100\% with 95\% {CI} (0.73, 1.00) and the specificity was 98\% with 95\% {CI} (0.91, 0.99) when the three uncertain cases were excluded.
{CONCLUSION}: Our study indicates that the {GMA} used in a clinical setting strongly predicts the development of {CP}. The work supports the results of previous studies and contributes to the validation of {GMA}. The qualitative nature of this method may be a problem for inexperienced observers. Larger clinical studies are needed.},

Results suggest a strong influence of the block shape, target location and movement number on the outcome measures.

The extensive research in this area resulted in relatively simple and robust techniques. Explicit complementary filter and Gradient descent based algorithm are such examples of the computationally simple and still efficient algorithms which are applicable to low cost tri-gyroscopes and tri-accelerometers based inertial measurement units ({IMUs}) using quaternion representation. These orientation estimators fuse gyro output for high frequency estimation along with accelerometer output for low frequency attitude estimation. This paper evaluates the performance of aforementioned two algorithms using both simulated and experimental data acquired from {IMU}. Simulated data was generated for known orientation to validate the filters performance whereas for experimental data; {MPU}6050 {IMU} was used for different scenarios. The assessment is based on the root mean square error computation for both algorithms. Moreover, both algorithms are equipped with adjustable parameters (filter gains) which were exploited for a range of values in the quest for perfection.},
