	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Preterm birth is the second largest direct cause of child deaths in children younger than 5 years. Yet, data regarding preterm birth ({\textless}37 completed weeks of gestation) are not routinely collected by {UN} agencies, and no systematic country estimates nor time trend analyses have been done. We report worldwide, regional, and national estimates of preterm birth rates for 184 countries in 2010 with time trends for selected countries, and provide a quantitative assessment of the uncertainty surrounding these estimates.
{METHODS}: We assessed various data sources according to prespecified inclusion criteria. National Registries (563 datapoints, 51 countries), Reproductive Health Surveys (13 datapoints, eight countries), and studies identified through systematic searches and unpublished data (162 datapoints, 40 countries) were included. 55 countries submitted additional data during {WHO}'s country consultation process. For 13 countries with adequate quality and quantity of data, we estimated preterm birth rates using country-level loess regression for 2010. For 171 countries, two regional multilevel statistical models were developed to estimate preterm birth rates for 2010. We estimated time trends from 1990 to 2010 for 65 countries with reliable time trend data and more than 10,000 livebirths per year. We calculated uncertainty ranges for all countries.
{FINDINGS}: In 2010, an estimated 14·9 million babies (uncertainty range 12·3-18·1 million) were born preterm, 11·1\% of all livebirths worldwide, ranging from about 5\% in several European countries to 18\% in some African countries. More than 60\% of preterm babies were born in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where 52\% of the global livebirths occur. Preterm birth also affects rich countries, for example, {USA} has high rates and is one of the ten countries with the highest numbers of preterm births. Of the 65 countries with estimated time trends, only three (Croatia, Ecuador, and Estonia), had reduced preterm birth rates 1990-2010.
{INTERPRETATION}: The burden of preterm birth is substantial and is increasing in those regions with reliable data. Improved recording of all pregnancy outcomes and standard application of preterm definitions is important. We recommend the addition of a data-quality indicator of the per cent of all live preterm births that are under 28 weeks' gestation. Distinguishing preterm births that are spontaneous from those that are provider-initiated is important to monitor trends associated with increased caesarean sections. Rapid scale up of basic interventions could accelerate progress towards Millennium Development Goal 4 for child survival and beyond.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Infants born preterm are at increased risk of developing cognitive and motor impairment compared with infants born at term. Early developmental interventions have been provided in the clinical setting with the aim of improving overall functional outcomes for these infants. Long-term benefits of these programmes remain unclear.
{OBJECTIVES}: Primary objective To compare the effectiveness of early developmental intervention programmes provided post hospital discharge to prevent motor or cognitive impairment in preterm ({\textless} 37 weeks) infants versus standard medical follow-up of preterm infants at infancy (zero to {\textless} three years), preschool age (three to {\textless} five years), school age (five to {\textless} 18 years) and adulthood (≥ 18 years). Secondary objectives To perform subgroup analyses to determine the following.• Effects of gestational age, birth weight and brain injury (periventricular leukomalacia ({PVL})/intraventricular haemorrhage ({IVH})) on cognitive and motor outcomes when early intervention is compared with standard follow-up. ∘ Gestational age: {\textless} 28 weeks, 28 to {\textless} 32 weeks, 32 to {\textless} 37 weeks. ∘ Birth weight: {\textless} 1000 grams, 1000 to {\textless} 1500 grams, 1500 to {\textless} 2500 grams. ∘ Brain injury: absence or presence of grade {III} or grade {IV} {IVH} or cystic {PVL} (or both) or an abnormal ultrasound/magnetic resonance image ({MRI}) before initiation of the intervention.• Effects of interventions started during inpatient stay with a post-discharge component versus standard follow-up care.• Effects of interventions focused on the parent-infant relationship, infant development or both compared with standard follow-up care.To perform sensitivity analysis to identify the following.• Effects on motor and cognitive impairment when early developmental interventions are provided within high-quality randomised trials with low risk of bias for sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome measures and selective reporting bias.
{SEARCH} {METHODS}: The search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used to identify randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of early developmental interventions provided post hospital discharge. Two review authors independently searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials ({CENTRAL}), {MEDLINE} Advanced, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature ({CINAHL}), {PsycINFO} and {EMBASE} (1966 to August 2015).
{SELECTION} {CRITERIA}: Studies included had to be randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of early developmental intervention programmes that began within the first 12 months of life for infants born before 37 weeks' gestational age. Interventions could commence on an inpatient basis but had to include a post-discharge component for inclusion in this review. Outcome measures were not prespecified, other than that they had to assess cognitive outcomes, motor outcomes or both. Rates of cerebral palsy were documented.
{DATA} {COLLECTION} {AND} {ANALYSIS}: Two independent review authors extracted and entered data. Cognitive and motor outcomes were pooled by four age groups: infancy (zero to {\textless} three years), preschool age (three to {\textless} five years), school age (five to {\textless} 18 years) and adulthood (≥ 18 years). Meta-analysis using {RevMan} 5.1 was carried out to determine the effects of early developmental interventions at each age range. Subgroup analyses focused on gestational age, birth weight, brain injury, commencement of the intervention, focus of the intervention and study quality.
{MAIN} {RESULTS}: Twenty-five studies met the inclusion criteria (3615 randomly assigned participants). Only 12 of these studies were randomised controlled trials with appropriate allocation concealment. Variability was evident with regard to focus and intensity of the intervention, participant characteristics and length of follow-up. Meta-analysis led to the conclusion that intervention improved cognitive outcomes at infancy (developmental quotient ({DQ}): standardised mean difference ({SMD}) 0.32 standard deviations ({SDs}), 95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 0.16 to 0.47; P value {\textless} 0.001; 16 studies; 2372 participants) and at preschool age (intelligence quotient ({IQ}); {SMD} 0.43 {SDs}, 95\% {CI} 0.32 to 0.54; P value {\textless} 0.001; eight studies; 1436 participants). However, this effect was not sustained at school age ({IQ}: {SMD} 0.18 {SDs}, 95\% {CI} -0.08 to 0.43; P value = 0.17; five studies; 1372 participants). Heterogeneity between studies for cognitive outcomes at infancy and at school age was significant. With regards to motor outcomes, meta-analysis of 12 studies showed a significant effect in favour of early developmental interventions at infancy only; however, this effect was small (motor scale {DQ}: {SMD} 0.10 {SDs}, 95\% {CI} 0.01 to 0.19; P value = 0.03; 12 studies; 1895 participants). No effect was noted on the rate of cerebral palsy among survivors (risk ratio ({RR}) 0.82, 95\% {CI} 0.52 to 1.27; seven studies; 985 participants). Little evidence showed a positive effect on motor outcomes in the long term, but only five included studies reported outcomes at preschool age (n = 3) or at school age (n = 2).
{AUTHORS}' {CONCLUSIONS}: Early intervention programmes for preterm infants have a positive influence on cognitive and motor outcomes during infancy, with cognitive benefits persisting into preschool age. A great deal of heterogeneity between studies was due to the variety of early developmental intervention programmes tested and to gestational ages of included preterm infants; thus, comparisons of intervention programmes were limited. Further research is needed to determine which early developmental interventions are most effective in improving cognitive and motor outcomes, and to discern the longer-term effects of these programmes.},

	abstract = {{AIM}: The aim of this study was to review the effects of early developmental intervention after discharge from hospital on motor and cognitive development in preterm infants.
{METHOD}: Randomized controlled trials ({RCTs}) or quasi-{RCTs} of early developmental intervention programmes for preterm infants in which motor or cognitive outcomes were reported and in which the intervention commenced before or after discharge were included. A systematic review and meta-analysis of studies grouped by intervention, age of outcome, and study quality was undertaken. Databases searched (up to January 2009) included the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, {MEDLINE}, {CINAHL}, {PsycINFO}, and Embase.
{RESULTS}: Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria (2686 patients randomized), but only 11 studies had data suitable for meta-analysis. Early developmental intervention improved cognitive outcomes at infant age (developmental quotient: standardized mean difference [{SMD}] 0.42, 95\% confidence interval [{CI}] 0.33-0.52; p{\textless}0.001), and at preschool age ({IQ}: {SMD} 0.46, 95\% {CI} 0.33-0.59; p{\textless}0.001). However, the benefit was not sustained at school age ({IQ}: {SMD} 0.02, 95\% {CI} -0.10 to 0.14; p=0.71). Early intervention had little effect on motor outcome at infant or school age, and there was no study reporting motor outcome at preschool age.
{INTERPRETATION}: Current evidence suggests that the benefits of developmental intervention postdischarge are restricted to short-term gains in cognitive outcome.},

These cutting-edge {MRI} scans, supported by high-performance computational tools and novel {ML} techniques, have opened up possibilities to unprecedentedly identify neurological disorders. However, similarities in disease phenotypes make it very difficult to detect such disorders accurately from the acquired neuroimaging data.

	isbn = {978-0-8058-5163-2},
	abstract = {Why include a chapter about physical and motor development in a book about developmental science? What is psychological about the body in motion? The answer is twofold. First, motor development is more than a list of developmental norms on a growth chart or a screening inventory. Motor behavior is integral to psychology. For those psychologists who believe that psychology is the study of behavior, movement is the stuff of the science. Behavior is movement. Infants' visual exploration of events, smiles and babbles to caregivers, manipulation of objects, and navigation of the environment involve movements of the eyes, mouth, arms, and legs. Alternatively, for those psychologists who believe that psychology is the study of mind, infants' movements are the medium for making inferences about thoughts, perceptions, and intentions that are not directly observable. Researchers rely on movements to study infants who cannot understand verbal questions or respond with spoken answers. Eye movements, smiles and cries, reaching, kicking, and walking are essential tools for studying infants' perception, cognition, emotion, and social interaction. Second, and perhaps more important, adaptive control of movement is a psychological problem in itself (Bertenthal \& Clifton, 1998). Motor action is inextricably coupled with perception, and motor development is implicated in the development of cognition and emotion. Burgeoning motor skills provide infants with new opportunities for learning. As Piaget (1954) pointed out, sensorimotor behavior is the fodder for cognition. This chapter focuses on the development of motor action in the fetal and infancy periods. ({PsycInfo} Database Record (c) 2023 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {Abstract Strategies for the early detection and diagnosis of cerebral palsy include multiple measures of the underlying brain abnormalities and their neurodevelopmental consequences. These measures can be grouped into the categories of pathogenesis, impairment, and functional limitation. Neuroimaging techniques are the most predictive measures of pathogenesis of cerebral palsy in both the preterm and term infant. Measures of neurological impairment focusing on muscle tone, reflexes, and other features of the neurological examination are poorly predictive in the first months of life. Detection of functional limitations manifested by motor developmental delay is sensitive and specific for later cerebral palsy, but not until well into the second 6 months of life. Abnormal spontaneous general movements in the infant 16 to 20 weeks postterm and earlier reflect functional limitations in the first months of life and have been shown to predict later cerebral palsy. Recognition of abnormal spontaneous general movements may improve early detection and diagnosis of cerebral palsy if these techniques can be successfully incorporated into organized follow-up programs and developmental surveillance.},

The {AIMS}, Prechtl's Assessment of General Movements ({GMs}), Neuro Sensory Motor Development Assessment ({NSMDA}), and {TIMP} were designed for preterm infants and are able to detect more subtle changes in movement quality. The best predictive assessment tools are age dependent: {GMs}, the Movement Assessment of Infants, and {TIMP} are strongest in early infancy (age 4 mo or less) and the {AIMS} and {NSMDA} are better at older ages (8-12 mo).

We examined the developmental trajectories of {HM} in five cohorts of at-risk infants and one control cohort, followed from ages 2 to 10 months: 25 West syndrome ({WS}), 13 preterm birth ({PB}), 16 orality disorder ({OD}), 14 with visually impaired mothers ({VIM}), 7 early hospitalization ({EH}), and 19 typically developing infants ({TD}). Video-recorded data were collected in three different structured interactive contexts. Descriptors of the hand motion were used to examine the extent to which {HM} were associated with age and cohort. We obtained four principal results: (i) the kinematics of {HM} (spatial use, curvature, acceleration, and velocity) were significantly associated with age in all cohorts; (ii) {HM} significantly differed at 5–6 months of age in {TD} infants, depending on the context; (iii) environmental and developmental factors shaped the developmental trajectories of {HM} in different cohorts: environment for {VIM}, development for {PB} and {WS}, and both factors for {OD} and; (iv) the curvatures of {HM} showed atypical development in {WS} infants when developmental age was considered. These findings support the importance of using kinematics of {HM} to identify very early developmental disorders in an interactive context and would allow early prevention and intervention for at-risk infants.},

The sensors are used consist of Inertial Measurement Unit (a 3- axis gyroscope with uncompensated bias and a 3-axis accelerometer) and a 3-axis magnetometer. To improve the accuracy of attitude estimation an extended Kalman filter ({EKF}) with a switching rule is used to fuse the sensory information. In practical applications, under the external acceleration, the output of accelerometer is not reliable due to its sensivity to vibration and non-separability the dynamic acceleration and gravity. To overcome this problem a switching rule is designed based on acceleration detection. If external acceleration is detected in rigid body movement, only magnetometer outputs will be used in {EKF} equations; otherwise, both of the accelerometer and magnetometer outputs will be employed. Through numerical simulations, the efficiency of the proposed method is illustrated under external acceleration.},
