Forty healthy infants were positioned in supine, prone and side-lying positions so that frequency and duration of the behaviors were quantified. Postural control when in supine and prone was also analyzed. The prone position elicited hand-mouth behavior in 0-2-month-old infants. The side-lying position elicited hand-mouth behavior in 3-4-month-old infants and hand-hand behavior in 2-4-month-olds. The increased postural control promoted the emergence of hand-hand behavior when in supine, and decreased hand-mouth behavior when in prone. The results show that self-exploratory behaviors may be affected not only by extrinsic constraints, represented by different body positions, but also by intrinsic constraints, represented by characteristic action possibilities and postural control of each age group.},

All but one infant were unimanual reachers at 5 months of age. Preferential reaching was space dependent rather than object dependent at this stage. Children reaching for objects in the right hemispace predominantly with their right hand showed a significantly greater right hand laterality at late preschool age than children who at the age of 5 months had shown inconsistent hand use (p {\textless} .05). Children who at the age of 5 months had reached for objects in the left hemispace with their left hand proved to be less lateralized in their right hand use approximately 5 years later (p {\textless} .05).},

	abstract = {The "ba, ba, ba" sound universal to babies' babbling around 7 months captures scientific attention because it provides insights into the mechanisms underlying language acquisition and vestiges of its evolutionary origins. Yet the prevailing mystery is what is the biological basis of babbling, with one hypothesis being that it is a non-linguistic motoric activity driven largely by the baby's emerging control over the mouth and jaw, and another being that it is a linguistic activity reflecting the babies' early sensitivity to specific phonetic-syllabic patterns. Two groups of hearing babies were studied over time (ages 6, 10, and 12 months), equal in all developmental respects except for the modality of language input (mouth versus hand): three hearing babies acquiring spoken language (group 1: "speech-exposed") and a rare group of three hearing babies acquiring sign language only, not speech (group 2: "sign-exposed"). Despite this latter group's exposure to sign, the motoric hypothesis would predict similar hand activity to that seen in speech-exposed hearing babies because language acquisition in sign-exposed babies does not involve the mouth. Using innovative quantitative Optotrak 3-D motion-tracking technology, applied here for the first time to study infant language acquisition, we obtained physical measurements similar to a speech spectrogram, but for the hands. Here we discovered that the specific rhythmic frequencies of the hands of the sign-exposed hearing babies differed depending on whether they were producing linguistic activity, which they produced at a low frequency of approximately 1 Hz, versus non-linguistic activity, which they produced at a higher frequency of approximately 2.5 Hz - the identical class of hand activity that the speech-exposed hearing babies produced nearly exclusively. Surprisingly, without benefit of the mouth, hearing sign-exposed babies alone babbled systematically on their hands. We conclude that babbling is fundamentally a linguistic activity and explain why the differentiation between linguistic and non-linguistic hand activity in a single manual modality (one distinct from the human mouth) could only have resulted if all babies are born with a sensitivity to specific rhythmic patterns at the heart of human language and the capacity to use them.},

Each assessment consisted of simultaneous recording of video-data and surface {EMGs} of arm, neck, trunk, and leg muscles in various lying and sitting positions. Additionally, postural adjustments during spontaneous arm movements were studied in a second group of five infants aged 1-3 months. Already before the onset of successful reaching, which occurred at 4 5 months, both spontaneous and goal-directed arm movements were accompanied by a high amount of postural activity. During the goal-directed arm movements a preference for neck muscle activation and a direction specific organisation (dorsal postural muscles activated before the ventral antagonists) prevailed, whereas during spontaneous arm movements such a specific postural organisation was absent. With increasing age and concurrent with successful reaching, the amount of postural activity decreased. Still, the persisting postural activity continued to become more organised with increasing age. Position affected the postural adjustments accompanying goal-directed arm movements at all ages.},

	abstract = {Adequate postural control is a prerequisite for daily activities such as reaching for an object. However, knowledge on the relationship between postural adjustments and the quality of reaching movements during human ontogeny is scarce. Therefore we evaluated the development of the relationship between the kinematic features of reaching movements and the accompanying postural adjustments in young infants. Twelve typically developing ({TD}) infants were assessed twice, i.e. at 4 and 6 months of age, in supine and supported sitting position. Reaching was elicited by presenting toys in the midline at an arm-length distance while simultaneously surface {EMG}-activity was recorded from multiple arm-, neck-, trunk- and leg muscles. Concurrently kinematics of reaching were recorded with an {ELITE} system; kinematic analysis was restricted to the behaviour of so-called movement units, which are sub movements of reaching determined with the help of peaks in the velocity profile of the hand, maximum movement velocity and movement duration. A computer-algorithm determined significant phasic muscle activity. Activity in neck and trunk muscles (postural activity) was related to the onset of the prime mover, which was the arm muscle being activated first. The results indicated that about 50\% of reaching movements in lying and sitting infants aged 4 and 6 months were accompanied by direction-specific postural adjustments. At 4 months variation dominated, but at 6 months a preference to recruit muscles in a top-down order (during sitting) and in the configuration of the complete pattern, i.e. the pattern in which all dorsal neck- and trunk muscles are activated in concert, (both conditions) emerged. Interestingly, the postural characteristics such as the presence of direction-specificity, recruitment of the complete pattern and top-down recruitment, were related to how successful the reaching was and the kinematics of reaching. It was concluded that the presence of direction-specific activity is not a prerequisite for the emergence of reaching movements. Nevertheless, already from 4 months onwards a better postural control is associated with a larger success and a better quality of reaching.},

This sensitivity regarding sensor displacement can turn out to be a serious problem with movement recordings of several minutes duration. We propose the "dislocation distance" as a novel method to quantify sensor displacement and to detect gradual and sudden changes of sensor orientation. Furthermore a method to define a so called fixed technical frame is proposed as a robust reference frame which can adapt to a new sensor orientation on the skin. The proposed methods are applied to quantify the effects of sensor displacement of 120 upper and lower limb movement recordings of newborns revealing the need for a method to compensate for sensor displacement. The reliability of the fixed technical frame is quantified and it is shown that trend and dispersion of the dislocation distance can be significantly reduced. A working example illustrates the consequences of sensor displacement on derived angle time series and how they are avoided using the fixed technical frame.},

In this study, the characteristics of spontaneous upper-extremity movements of premature infants with brain injuries and those without brain injuries were examined with time series analysis., Subjects: Participants were 7 premature infants with brain injuries and 7 matched, low-risk, premature infants at the age of 1 month after term., Methods: A triaxial accelerometer was used to measure upper-extremity limb acceleration in 3-dimensional space. Acceleration signals were recorded from the right wrist when the infant was in an active, alert state and lying in the supine position. The recording time was 200 seconds. The acceleration signal was sampled at a rate of 200 Hz. The acceleration time series data were analyzed by nonlinear analysis as well as linear analysis., Results: The nonlinear time series analysis indicated that spontaneous movements of premature infants have nonlinear, chaotic, dynamic characteristics. The movements of the infants with brain injuries were characterized by larger dimensionality, and they were more unstable and unpredictable than those of infants without brain injuries., Discussion and Conclusion: As determined by nonlinear analysis, the spontaneous movements of the premature infants with brain injuries had the characteristics of increased disorganization compared with those of the infants without brain injuries. Infants with brain injuries may manifest problems with self-organization as a function of the coordination of subsystems. Physical therapists should be able to support interactions among the subsystems and promote self-organization of motor learning through the individualized provision of various sensorimotor experiences for infants.},

Participants were 8 healthy full-term newborn infants (3 boys, 5 girls, mean birth weight and gestational age were 3070.6 g and 39 weeks). A tri-axial accelerometer measured limb movement acceleration in 3-dimensional space. Movement acceleration signals were recorded during 200 s from just below the ankle when the infant was in an active alert state and lying supine (sampling rate 200 Hz). Data were analyzed linearly and nonlinearly. As a result, the optimal embedding dimension showed more than 5 at all times. Time dependent changes started at 6 or 7, and over the next four months decreased to 5 and from 6 months old, increased. The maximal Lyapnov exponent was positive for all segments. The mutual information is at its greatest range at 0 months. Between 3 and 4 months the range in results is narrowest and lowest in value. The mean coefficient of correlation for the x-axis component was negative and y-axis component changed to a positive value between 1 month old and 4 months old. Nonlinear time series analysis suggested that newborn and young infants' spontaneous lower extremity movements are characterized by a nonlinear chaotic dynamics with 5 to 7 embedding dimensions. Developmental changes of an optimal embedding dimension showed a U-shaped phenomenon. In addition, the maximal Lyapnov exponents were positive for all segments (0.79-2.99). Infants' spontaneous movement involves chaotic dynamic systems that are capable of generating voluntary skill movements.},

	abstract = {Inexpensive inertial/magnetic measurement units can be found in numerous applications and are typically used to determine orientation. Due to the presence of nonidealities in measurement systems, the calibration of the sensor is thus needed to determine sensor parameters such as bias, misalignment, and gain/sensitivity. In this paper, an online automatic calibration method for a three-axial accelerometer is presented. Parameters are estimated using an unscented Kalman filter. The sensor is placed in a number of different orientations using a robotic arm. These orientations are calculated online from the parameter covariance matrix and represent estimated optimal sensor orientations for parameter estimation. Numerous simulations are run to evaluate the proposed calibration method, and a comparison is made with an offline least mean squares calibration method. The simulation results show that calibration with the proposed method results in higher accuracy of parameter estimation when using less than 100 iterations. The proposed calibration method is also applied to a real accelerometer using a low number of iterations. The results show only slight (less than 0.4\%) changes in parameter values between different calibration runs. The proposed calibration method provides an accurate parameter estimation using a small number of iterations without the need for manually predefining orientations of the sensor, and the method can be used in combination with other offline calibration methods to achieve even higher accuracy.},

	abstract = {Background
Existing motor pattern assessment methods, such as digital cameras and optoelectronic systems, suffer from object obstruction and require complex setups. To overcome these drawbacks, this paper presents a novel approach for biomechanical evaluation of newborn motor skills development. Multi-sensor measurement system comprising pressure mattress and {IMUs} fixed on trunk and arms is proposed and used as alternative to existing methods. Observed advantages seem appealing for the focused field and in general. Combined use of pressure distribution data and kinematic information is important also for posture assessment, ulcer prevention, and non-invasive sleep pattern analysis of adults.

Methods
Arm kinematic parameters, such as root-mean-square acceleration, spectral arc length of hand velocity profile, including arm workspace surface area, and travelled hand path are obtained with the multi-sensor measurement system and compared to normative motion capture data for evaluation of adequacy. Two {IMUs} per arm, only one {IMU} on upper arm, and only one {IMU} on forearm sensor placement options are studied to assess influence of system configuration on method precision. Combination of pressure mattress and {IMU} fixed on the trunk is used to measure trunk position (obtained from mat), rotation (from {IMUs}) and associated movements on surface (from both). Measurement system is first validated on spontaneous arm and trunk movements of a dedicated baby doll having realistic anthropometric characteristics of newborns. Next, parameters of movements in a healthy infant are obtained with pressure mattress, along with trunk and forearm {IMU} sensors to verify appropriateness of method and parameters.

Results
Evaluation results confirm that full sensor set, comprising pressure mattress and two {IMUs} per arm is a reliable substitution to optoelectronic systems. Motor pattern parameter errors are under 10\% and kinematic estimation error is in range of 2 cm. Although, use of only forearm {IMU} is not providing best possible kinematic precision, the simplicity of use and still acceptable accuracy are convincing for frequent practical use. Measurements demonstrated system high mobility and usability.

Conclusions
Study results confirm adequacy of the proposed multi-sensor measurement system, indicating its enviable potential for accurate infant trunk posture and arm movement assessment.
